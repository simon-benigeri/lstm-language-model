[ read our live updates on coronavirus cases and deaths globally . ] </s>  we don ’ t really know when the novel coronavirus first began infecting people . </s>  but as we turn a page on our calendars into june , it is fair to say that sars-cov-2 has been with us now for a full six months . </s>  at first , it had no name or true identity . </s>  early in january , news reports referred to strange and threatening symptoms that had sickened dozens of people in a large chinese city with which many people in the world were probably not familiar . </s>  after half a year , that large metropolis , wuhan , is well-known , as is the coronavirus and the illness it causes , covid-19 . </s>  in that time , many reporters and editors on the health and science desk at the new york times have shifted our journalistic focus as we have sought to tell the story of the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  while much remains unknown and mysterious after six months , there are some things we ’ re pretty sure of . </s>  these are some of those insights . </s>  here are some things we think we know about coronavirus : we ’ ll have to live with this for a long time . </s>  you should be wearing a mask . </s>

virus . </s>  we can ’ t count on warm weather to defeat the virus . </s>  we ’ ll have to live with this for a long time . </s>  by denise grady summer is almost here , states are reopening and new coronavirus cases are declining or , at least , holding steady in many parts of the united states . </s>  at least 100 scientific teams around the world are racing to develop a vaccine . </s>  that ’ s about it for the good news . </s>  the virus has shown no sign of going away : we will be in this pandemic era for the long haul , likely a year or more . </s>  the masks , the social distancing , the fretful hand-washing , the aching withdrawal from friends and family — those steps are still the best hope of staying well , and will be for some time to come . </s>  “ this virus just may become another endemic virus in our communities , and this virus may never go away , ” dr. mike ryan , the executive director of the world health organization ’ s health emergencies program , warned last month . </s>  some scientists think that the longer we live with the virus , the milder its effects will become , but that remains to be seen . </s>  predictions that millions of doses of a vaccine may be available by the end of this year may be too rosy . </s>  no vaccine has ever been created that fast . </s>  the disease would be less frightening if there were a treatment that could cure it or , at least , prevent severe illness . </s>  but there is not . </s>  remdesivir , the eagerly awaited antiviral drug ? </s>  “ modest ” benefit is the highest mark experts give it . </s>  which brings us back to masks and social distancing , which have come to feel quite antisocial . </s>  if only we could go back to life the way it used to be . </s>  we can not . </s>  not yet . </s>  there are just enough wild cards with this disease — perfectly healthy adults and children who inexplicably become very , very sick — that no one can afford to be cavalier about catching it . </s>  about 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all , so if they are out and about , they could unknowingly infect other people . </s>  enormous questions loom . </s>  can workplaces be made safe ? </s>  what about trains , subways , airplanes , school buses ? </s>  how many people can work from home ? </s>  when would it be safe to reopen schools ? </s>  how do you get a 6-year-old with the attention span of a squirrel to socially distance ? </s>  the bottom line : wear a mask , keep your distance . </s>  when the time comes in the fall , get a flu shot , to protect yourself from one respiratory disease you can avoid and to help keep emergency rooms and urgent care from being overwhelmed . </s>  hope for a treatment , a cure , a vaccine . </s>  be patient . </s>  we have to pace ourselves . </s>  if there ’ s such a thing as a disease marathon , this is it . </s>  you should be wearing a mask . </s>  by knvul sheikh the debate over whether americans should wear face masks to control coronavirus transmission has been settled . </s>  although public health authorities gave confusing and often contradictory advice in the early months of the pandemic , most experts now agree that if everyone wears a mask , individuals protect one another . </s>  researchers know that even simple masks can effectively stop droplets spewing from an infected wearer ’ s nose or mouth . </s>  in a study published in april in nature , scientists showed that when people who are infected with influenza , rhinovirus or a mild cold-causing coronavirus wore a mask , it blocked nearly 100 percent of the viral droplets they exhaled , as well as some tiny aerosol particles . </s>  still , mask wearing remains uneven in many parts of the united states . </s>  but governments and businesses are beginning to require , or at least recommend , that masks be worn in many public settings . </s>  there is also growing evidence that some kinds of masks may protect you from other people ’ s germs . </s>  high-grade n95 masks are cleared by federal public health agencies because they filter out at least 95 percent of particles that are 0.3 microns in diameter when properly worn . </s>  one study showed that n95s were able to capture over 90 percent of viral particles , even if the particles were about one-fifth the size of a coronavirus . </s>  other studies have shown that flat , blue surgical masks block between 50 to 80 percent of particles , whereas cloth masks block 10 to 30 percent of tiny particles . </s>  “ wearing a mask is better than nothing , ” said dr. robert atmar , an infectious disease specialist at baylor college of medicine . </s>  because the coronavirus typically infects people by entering their body through the mouth and nose , covering these areas can act as the first line of defense against the virus , he said . </s>  donning a face covering is also likely to prevent you from touching your face , which is another way the coronavirus can be transmitted from contaminated surfaces to unsuspecting individuals . </s>  and when combined with hand washing and other protective measures , such as social distancing , masks help reduce the transmission of disease , dr. atmar said . </s>  american public health infrastructure needs an update . </s>  by donald g. mcneil jr . </s>  the united states knows how to fight wars . </s>  but , as the past few months have shown , the american response to pathogens can easily become a shambles — even though pathogens kill more americans than many wars have . </s>  we have no viral pentagon . </s>  the centers for disease control and prevention is more of an f.b.i . </s>  for outbreak investigations than a war machine . </s>  for years — under both the obama and trump administrations — its leaders have had to seek clearance for almost every utterance . </s>  dr. anthony s. fauci , the most prominent of the doctors advising the coronavirus task force , is actually the head of a research institute , the national institute for allergy and infectious disease , rather than of the medical equivalent of a combat battalion . </s>  the surgeon general is essentially an admiral without a crew . </s>  he dispenses health warnings and recommendations , but the public health services commissioned corps , which reports to him , are only about 6,500 strong , and many members have other jobs , often at the c.d.c . </s>  almost all the front-line troops — the contact tracers , the laboratory technicians , the epidemiologists , the staff in state and city hospitals — are paid by state and local health departments whose budgets have shriveled for years . </s>  these soldiers are led by 50 commanders , in the form of governors , and with that many in charge , it is amazing that any response moves _forward . </s>  the rest of the response is in the hands of thousands of private militias — hospitals , insurers , doctors , nurses , respiratory technicians , pharmacists and so on , all of whom have individual employers . </s>  within limits , they can do what they want . </s>  when they can not get something they need from overseas , they are largely powerless without federal logistical help . </s>  as war does to defeated nations , pandemics expose the weaknesses of their systems . </s>  our patchwork and uncoordinated response has produced more than 100,000 deaths ; surely we can do better . </s>  “ the superpowers have their priorities all wrong , ” dr. michael ryan , the head of the w.h.o. ’ s emergencies program , said recently . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak

and on fighting terrorism , and pennies on viruses . </s>  you can start peace talks with your enemy . </s>  you can change your policies to lessen the threat of terrorism . </s>  but you can not negotiate with a virus , and we know that new threats are coming along every year. ” [ like the science times page on facebook . </s>  | sign up for the science times newsletter . ] </s>  responding to the virus is extraordinarily expensive . </s>  by reed abelson the federal government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars and promised to spend more than $ 2 trillion to address the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  of that money , $ 2 billion has gone to helping companies develop new vaccines , expanding testing capacity nationwide and shoring up the economic fallout since the beginning of march . </s>  ( even more could be on the way , but how much and when is unclear . ) </s>  the vast majority of this spending has been aimed at blunting the economic pain of small businesses shutting down and people losing their jobs or being furloughed . </s>  congress also provided additional money for medicaid and other social programs . </s>  hospitals , community health centers and other providers have been allocated $ 175 billion to cover the cost of caring for patients with covid-19 and for the visits , procedures and surgeries that were canceled because of the pandemic . </s>  in the latest bill , $ 25 billion was targeted for coronavirus testing . </s>  many experts say more funding is needed , but there is ample controversy over how the money already allocated is being spent and which entities are getting funds . </s>  various groups like the committee for a responsible federal budget are tracking the spending . </s>  by that organization ’ s calculation , roughly $ 1.6 trillion has already been disbursed or committed . </s>  the federal reserve has also provided more than $ 2 trillion in emergency lending , asset purchases and other activities , it said . </s>  we have a long way to go to fix virus testing . </s>  by katie thomas the landscape for testing looks far better than it did in the early days of the outbreak , when a botched rollout of coronavirus tests failed to detect the spread of the virus in the united states . </s>  today , hundreds of thousands of tests a day are being conducted in the united states , and in some areas it is so widely available that public health officials have complained they do not have enough takers . </s>  in los angeles , where testing is free to everyone , a drive-through site at dodgers stadium can process 6,000 people a day . </s>  the range of tests available is also expanding . </s>  tests that once required a health care worker to insert a swab through the nose to the back of the throat can now be done with a swipe inside the nose , or by spitting into a cup . </s>  a handful of companies now sell at-home test kits , and a test from abbott can detect the virus in as little as five minutes . </s>  in addition to the tests that detect active infections , americans can also get tested for antibodies to the virus , which shows whether they have ever been infected , and could help give a better picture for how widely the coronavirus has spread in communities . </s>  but despite this progress , the united states still has a long way to go . </s>  public health experts say that anywhere from 900,000 tests to millions a day will be needed to screen hospital patients , nursing home residents and employees returning to work . </s>  and even as testing is abundant in some areas , it is still hard to come by in others . </s>  shortages of key supplies needed to run the tests — such as swabs and chemical reagents — have persisted . </s>  the federal government has effectively delegated oversight to the states , creating a patchwork of policies and putting states in competition with one another . </s>  even tracking the number of tests conducted has proved difficult , after the c.d.c . </s>  and several states began lumping tests for the virus as well as antibodies together , to the bafflement of epidemiologists trying to track active infections , which the antibody tests do not show . </s>  we can ’ t count on herd immunity to keep us healthy . </s>  by gina kolata the idea is simplicity itself : if enough of the population has antibodies to the novel coronavirus , the virus will hit too many dead ends to continue infecting people . </s>  that is herd immunity . </s>  that is the great hope for a vaccine . </s>  but it may not happen , even if a vaccine becomes available , as experience with flu vaccines shows . </s>  dr. paul offit of children ’ s hospital of philadelphia and the university of pennsylvania noted that while vaccines eliminated measles , rubella and smallpox and almost eliminated polio in the united states , vaccines against influenza and whooping cough have not stopped outbreaks . </s>  ( with some parents declining measles vaccines , the disease is coming back . ) </s>  influenza and whooping cough have spread , even after enough people in a community have been vaccinated to , in theory , stop the diseases . </s>  that ’ s because the antibodies that protect people against viruses infecting mucosal surfaces like the lining of the nose tend to be short-lived . </s>  vaccines against respiratory diseases are , at best , modestly effective , agreed dr. arnold monto of the university of michigan , the coronavirus outbreak › words to know about testing confused by the terms about coronavirus testing ? </s>  let us help : antibody : a protein produced by the immune system that can recognize and attach precisely to specific kinds of viruses , bacteria , or other invaders . </s>  antibody test/serology test : a test that detects antibodies specific to the coronavirus . </s>  antibodies begin to appear in the blood about a week after the coronavirus has infected the body . </s>  because antibodies take so long to develop , an antibody test can ’ t reliably diagnose an ongoing infection . </s>  but it can identify people who have been exposed to the coronavirus in the past . </s>  antigen test : this test detects bits of coronavirus proteins called antigens . </s>  antigen tests are fast , taking as little as five minutes , but are less accurate than tests that detect genetic material from the virus . </s>  coronavirus : any virus that belongs to the orthocoronavirinae family of viruses . </s>  the coronavirus that causes covid-19 is known as sars-cov-2 . </s>  covid-19 : the disease caused by the new coronavirus . </s>  the name is short for coronavirus disease 2019 . </s>  isolation and quarantine : isolation is the separation of people who know they are sick with a contagious disease from those who are not sick . </s>  quarantine refers to restricting the movement of people who have been exposed to a virus . </s>  nasopharyngeal swab : a long , flexible stick , tipped with a soft swab , that is inserted deep into the nose to get samples from the space where the nasal cavity meets the throat . </s>  samples for coronavirus tests can also be collected with swabs that do not go as deep into the nose — sometimes called nasal swabs — or oral or throat swabs . </s>  polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) : scientists use pcr to make millions of copies of genetic material in a sample . </s>  tests that use pcr enable researchers to detect the coronavirus even when it is scarce . </s>  viral load : the amount of virus in a person ’ s body . </s>  in people infected by the coronavirus , the viral load may peak before they start to show symptoms , if symptoms appear at all . </s>  since the coronavirus usually starts by infecting the respiratory system , dr. monto suspects that a covid-19 vaccine would have a similar effect to a flu vaccine — it will reduce the incidence of the disease and make it less severe on average , but it will not make covid-19 go away . </s>  he would like the virus to disappear , of course , but a vaccine that reduces the disease ’ s spread and severity is a lot better than nothing . </s>  “ as an older person , what i want is not to end up on a respirator , ” dr. monto said . </s>  the virus produces more symptoms than expected . </s>  by roni caryn rabin covid-19 is a viral respiratory illness . </s>  many early descriptions of symptoms focused on patients being short of breath and eventually being placed on ventilators . </s>  but the virus does not confine its assault to the lungs , and doctors have identified a number of symptoms and syndromes associated with it . </s>  in some patients , the virus propels the immune system into overdrive , causing the lungs to fill with fluid and damaging multiple organs , including the brain , heart , kidneys and liver . </s>  the first symptoms of an infection are usually a cough and shortness of breath . </s>  but in april the c.d.c . </s>  added to the list of early signs sore throat , fever , chills and muscle aches . </s>  gastrointestinal upset , such as diarrhea and nausea , has also been observed . </s>  another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden , profound diminution of one ’ s sense of smell and taste . </s>  teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on the fingers and toes , but few other serious symptoms . </s>  severe disease leads to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . </s>  the blood oxygen levels plummet , and patients may get supplemental oxygen or be placed on a machine , called a ventilator , to help them breathe . </s>  but even without lung impairment , the disease can cause injury to the kidneys , heart or liver . </s>  critically ill patients are prone to developing dangerous blood clots in the legs and the lungs . </s>  in rare cases , the disease triggers ischemic strokes that block the arteries supplying blood to the brain , or brain impairments , such as altered mental status or encephalopathy . </s>  death can result from heart failure , kidney failure , multiple organ failure , respiratory distress or shock . </s>  we can worry a bit less about infection from surfaces . </s>  by apoorva mandavilli the news , when it was reported , added a frightening twist to the threat from the coronavirus : a study in march in the new england journal of medicine found that under laboratory conditions , the virus can survive for up to three days on some surfaces , such as plastic and steel , and on cardboard for up to 24 hours . </s>  other studies reported finding the virus on air vents in hospital rooms and on computer mice , sickbed handrails and doorknobs . </s>  many people grew worried that by touching a surface that had been covered in droplets by an infected person , and then touching their own mouth , nose or eyes , they then would contract the virus . </s>  you should still wear a mask , avoid touching your face in public and keep washing your hands . </s>  but none of these studies tested for live virus , only for traces of its genetic material . </s>  other scientists commenting on these studies said virus on these surfaces might degrade more quickly . </s>  the centers for disease control and prevention has said since march that contaminated surfaces are “ not thought to be the main way ” the virus spreads . </s>  the main driver of infection is thought to be directly inhaling droplets released when an infected person sneezes , coughs , sings or talks . </s>  the c.d.c . </s>  recently made changes to its website to make this message even more explicit . </s>  we can also worry less about a mutating virus . </s>  by carl zimmer in february , three experts on viruses published an editorial in a journal headlined “ we shouldn ’ t worry when a virus mutates during outbreaks. ” but worry we did . </s>  as the coronavirus pandemic swept the planet , headlines and tweets poured forth that the new coronavirus was undergoing dangerous mutations . </s>  many of these worries were based on a misunderstanding of what it means when a virus mutates . </s>  when an infected cell produces new viruses , it sometimes makes mistakes in copying the viral genes . </s>  those mistakes are mutations , and it turns out that most are bad for the viruses , getting in the way of their ability to hijack our cells . </s>  the viruses that do manage to spread to new hosts have mutations , too . </s>  but those mutations often don ’ t have any significant effect . </s>  the alterations they bring to a virus ’ s genes don ’ t lead to any change in how the virus works . </s>  scientists have identified harmless new mutations in different lineages of the new coronavirus . </s>  these lineages are not dangerous new strains . </s>  some of these lineages have come to be the most common version of the coronavirus in some countries . </s>  again , that doesn ’ t mean that they ’ ve got some evolutionary edge . </s>  there ’ s a very common phenomenon in nature called the founder effect : whatever mutations happen to be common in the founders of a new population will end up common in their descendants . </s>  it is possible for viruses to gain mutations that do affect the way they work . </s>  the new coronavirus will be no different . </s>  but the only way to know if a new mutation is significant or not is to carry out research . </s>  it will take a lot of evidence to reject the more likely hypothesis : that a new mutation has no importance at all . </s>  fortunately , it doesn ’ t look like coronaviruses will be picking up these new mutations very quickly . </s>  compared with other viruses , scientists have found , the new coronavirus has a relatively slow rate of new mutations . </s>  that ’ s a big relief for vaccine makers . </s>  influenza viruses mutate so quickly that people need to get a new flu shot each year to stay protected . </s>  h.i.v . </s>  has so much genetic diversity that an effective vaccine against it has yet to be found . </s>  the new coronavirus poses immense challenges to vaccine makers , but most of them have to do with manufacturing billions of doses in a matter of months . </s>  we have enough worries when it comes to covid-19 ; no need to add needless ones to the list . </s>  we can ’ t count on warm weather to defeat the virus . </s>  by james gorman the hot and humid weather of summer will not stop the pandemic . </s>  more sunlight and humidity may slow down its spread , but we probably won ’ t know by how much . </s>  other factors , like reduced travel , increased personal distance , closed schools , canceled gatherings and mask-wearing , have effects that would outweigh the influence of the weather . </s>  a few things are known about conditions that do or do not favor the virus . </s>  the ultraviolet rays in sunlight help destroy the virus on surfaces and some studies have shown a small effect from humidity . </s>  it seems to last longest on hard surfaces like plastic and metal . </s>  it won ’ t survive in pool or lake or seawater . </s>  wind disperses it . </s>  risk of transmission is lower outdoors than indoors . </s>  a wooden bench under a bright sun at a breezy beach is a better bet than a metal and plastic recliner on the shady side of the pool . </s>  but if someone infected sits near you and coughs , or talks a lot or sings , it doesn ’ t really matter where you ’ re sitting and how nice a day it is . </s>  “ the virus doesn ’ t need favorable conditions , ” said peter juni , an epidemiologist at the university of toronto . </s>  it has a world population with no immunity waiting to be infected . </s>  bring on the sun ; the novel coronavirus will survive . </s>  air conditioning may blow the virus right to your restaurant table . </s>  on memorial day , many people in the united states gathered in congenial closeness in lovely weather without masks . </s>  if any of them were infected and breathing , they probably infected someone else . </s>  the same will be true on july 4 . </s>  even if the weather is glorious . </s>

delivered to your inbox . ] </s>  as the coronavirus snakes its way around the world — canceling events , shuttering offices and suspending classes — some health experts worry that the crisis could put women at a disproportionate risk , exacerbating gender , social and economic fault lines . </s>  typical gender roles can “ influence where men and women spend their time , and the infectious agents they come into contact with , as well as the nature of exposure , its frequency and its intensity , ” declared the world health organization in a 2007 report . </s>  in other words : the roles that women have in society could place them squarely in the virus ’ s path ( although some early studies of coronavirus cases in china suggest men have a higher death rate ) . </s>  around the world , women make up a majority of health care workers , almost 70 percent according to some estimates , and most of them occupy nursing roles — on the front lines of efforts to combat and contain outbreaks of disease . </s>  in china ’ s hubei province , where the current coronavirus outbreak originated , about 90 percent of health care workers are women . </s>  in the u.s. , that number is around 78 percent . </s>  nurses ’ levels of exposure are “ higher than doctors ’ , ” said dr. celine gounder , an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist , because “ they ’ re much more involved in intimate care of patients . </s>  they ’ re the ones drawing blood , they ’ re the ones collecting specimens. ” that situation is also found in nursing homes , which have been the epicenter of infections in washington state . </s>  of the more than 8,000 probable sars cases around the world in the early 2000s , more than half were female and about 21 percent of total cases occurred among health care workers , according to the w.h.o . </s>  women around the world are also more likely to take on the burden of care at home , particularly if someone in their family is sick , gounder added . </s>  and because women still bear most of the responsibility of child-rearing , when schools are suspended that risk may be compounded . </s>  data from china suggests that the disease is most easily spread between family members who are in frequent contact with one another . </s>  this was also the case during the numerous ebola outbreaks across africa from 1976 to 2014 . </s>  because women are traditionally the primary caregivers and are responsible for preparing bodies for burial , their vulnerability to the disease increased , according to a 2017 study . </s>  “ the transmission rate was higher in households than in hospitals ” and though there is no evidence of a biological gender gap when it comes to vulnerability to ebola , “ more cases were recorded among women than men ” during the 2014 outbreak . </s>  pregnant women are faced with a whole different set of challenges — especially the stress of not knowing exactly how coronavirus might affect their child . </s>  the

to be transmitted from a mother to her fetus . </s>  the centers for disease control and prevention does caution that it has observed miscarriage and stillbirth in pregnant women infected with other coronaviruses like sars and mers , but again , it ’ s unclear why . </s>  economically speaking , outbreaks could have a disproportionately negative impact on women , who make up a large chunk of part-time and informal workers around the world . </s>  those kinds of jobs are also usually the first to get sliced in periods of economic uncertainty . </s>  and during outbreaks , when women have to give up work and income to stay home , they often find it harder to spring back after the crisis , said dr. julia smith , a health policy researcher at simon fraser university . </s>  for example , while “ everybody ’ s income was affected by the ebola outbreak in west africa , ” smith said , “ men ’ s income returned to what they had made pre-outbreak faster than women ’ s income. ” the

italian brand has joined the chorus of brands and retailers calling for a permanent reset of the fashion system because of covid-19 , adding the weight of a giant global name to the movement . </s>  on monday , alessandro michele , the creative director of gucci , held a video news conference to announce that the brand will reduce the number of shows it holds each year from five to two , effectively abandoning the idea of cruise shows — the far-flung midseason extravaganzas it has held at a roman necropolis in arles and the capitoline museum in rome ( among other places ) . </s>  he also wants to do away with the distinction between men ’ s wear and women ’ s wear , and the traditional appellations of fall/winter and spring/summer . </s>  “ i will abandon the worn-out ritual of seasonalities and shows , ” mr. michele wrote . </s>  gucci is not the first brand to announce a change in its runway plans in response to the pandemic , which has brought the industry to an effective standstill , closing stores and decimating balance sheets . </s>  saint laurent , also owned by kering , the gucci parent company , said it would drop out of the fashion show season and follow its own schedule for this year ; dries van noten said he would not have a show at all until 2021 ; and giorgio armani announced that his men ’ s and women ’ s shows would be combined in september , and his

ease the burdens of lockdown on young readers . </s>  the tale , titled “ the ickabog , ” will be released in installments online , and available for free . </s>  it will be published as a book in november . </s>  in an announcement on her website , ms. rowling said she had started working on the book years ago , while she was still writing harry potter , and originally intended to publish it after she finished the last book in the beloved series . </s>  but she ended up keeping “ the ickabog , ” which isn ’ t related to harry potter or any of ms. rowling ’ s other work , in her family , reading it to her young children and then putting it away in her attic until recently . </s>  she decided to release “ the ickabog ” now , she wrote on twitter , “ so children on lockdown , or even those back at school during these strange , unsettling times , can read it or have it read to them. ” ms. rowling said she would donate her royalties for the book to causes related to the pandemic . </s>  nicaragua , still promoting mass events , offers a ( lengthy ) justification . </s>  facing withering criticism over its cavalier response to the outbreak and claims that it is understating the toll of the pandemic , the government of nicaragua released a 71-page rebuttal on monday , arguing that a vast majority of nicaraguans could not afford to lose work in a strict lockdown . </s>  nicaragua , the second-poorest country in the hemisphere , has been widely criticized for continuing to allow mass events . </s>  it also is among a handful of nations worldwide that never closed its schools . </s>  nicaragua has reported 759 cases since the pandemic began , and just 35 deaths . </s>  but the citizen observatory , a group of doctors , activists and other volunteers who collect information from hospitals , said it has counted 2,323 cases and 404 deaths . </s>  in its new document , the government said those estimates are inflated with routine pneumonia deaths . </s>  in the document , which was posted online , the government also claimed that critics were trying to undermine the government of president daniel ortega and compared the administration ’ s approach to that of sweden , which never locked down its economy . </s>  “ countries that have totally closed their economies are uncomfortable with the example of countries that do not apply a draconian closure and do not destroy their economies to face the pandemic , ” the government said . </s>  while sweden has avoided devastating tolls like those in italy or britain , the outbreak there has been far deadlier than those of its scandinavian neighbors . </s>  public health experts , doctors and other critics have blasted the document because it failed to say how many people had been tested for the disease or to offer an assessment of the nation ’ s hospitals . </s>  the country is still reeling economically after a 2018 uprising threatened mr. ortega ’ s hold on power and cost nicaragua more than 150,000 jobs . </s>  mr. ortega has since clamped down on dissent and the government is now saying its opponents want to use the pandemic for political ends . </s>  russia sets a new date for victory parades , even as infections rise . </s>  gambling that russia can contain its coronavirus outbreak , president vladimir v. putin on tuesday ordered that military parades to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the russian victory over nazi germany — originally scheduled for may 9 but canceled because of the pandemic — go ahead next month across the country . </s>  russia , with more than 360,000 confirmed infections , is the third hardest-hit country after the united states and brazil , and is still struggling with nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases a day . </s>  but it has slowed the outbreak slightly over the past week , a trend that mr. putin hopes will hold long enough to limit the risks of allowing tens of thousands of soldiers to march through moscow ’ s red square and to take part in smaller parades in other cities . </s>  mr. putin , in a video conference with his defense minister shown on state television , said the parades would now be held on june 24 , the date chosen by the soviet dictator stalin for the red army ’ s first red square victory parade in 1945 . </s>  mr. putin described that event as “ a legendary historical parade of the victors ” who “ liberated europe. ” separate marches by millions of ordinary russians whose relatives fought during world war ii , a conflict known in russia as the great patriotic war , will be held a month later , mr. putin said . </s>  the delay until july 26 of the so-called immortal regiment marches , mr. putin said , was necessary to reduce the danger of having so many people on the streets at one time . </s>  even so , it is far from certain that russia will have put the pandemic behind it by late june or even july , despite a flurry of reports on kremlin-controlled media outlets in recent days trumpeting what they present as russia ’ s victory over the virus . </s>  official figures showing a remarkably low death toll compared with the united states and european countries have been hailed as evidence of a “ russian miracle. ” mr. putin has put celebration of russia ’ s wartime sacrifice and victory at the center of a political program built around often strident patriotism and denunciation of his opponents as traitors . </s>  state television has been saturated for weeks with reports of wartime heroism and sometimes vicious attacks on anyone who challenges russia ’ s status as europe ’ s savior . </s>  citing safety concerns , the w.h.o . </s>  pauses tests of a drug trump said he had taken . </s>  the world health organization said on monday that safety concerns had prompted it to temporarily remove the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine — which mr. trump said he had taken in hopes of warding off the coronavirus , despite the lack of evidence that it works — from a global drug trial aimed at finding treatments for covid-19 . </s>  dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus , the organization ’ s director-general , said officials had decided on a “ temporary pause ” in testing the drug after the lancet published an observational study last week that found that people who took the drug were more likely to die . </s>  several earlier studies had also found no benefit — and possible harm — when the drug was used by covid-19 patients . </s>  dr. tedros said his agency would review safety data . </s>  hydroxychloroquine had been one of several drugs and drug combinations that the world health organization was testing against covid-19 . </s>  the test , called the solidarity trial , has enrolled nearly 3,500 patients so far from 17 countries , officials said . </s>  dr. tedros noted that the concerns related to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine , another malaria drug , were specifically about their use by covid-19 patients . </s>  “ i wish to reiterate that these drugs are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria , ” he said . </s>  mr. trump , who has long promoted hydroxychloroquine despite the lack of evidence that it works against the virus , made the startling announcement this month that he had taken it himself as a preventive measure . </s>  fearing the spread of disease , china zeros in on a ubiquitous utensil : chopsticks . </s>  amy qin is a china correspondent for the new york times covering the intersection of culture , politics and society . </s>  the coronavirus has forced us all to rethink our everyday habits , including things we once took for granted like shaking hands or wearing shoes inside the house . </s>  so when my editors recently asked me to look into a story about the chinese government ’ s recent campaign to promote the use of serving chopsticks , it also prompted some self-reflection . </s>  growing up in a chinese household in the united states , we almost always ate family-style , using our personal chopsticks to reach into dishes of food that had been placed in the middle of the table . </s>  some of my most vivid memories from childhood involve my mom , in the well-established tradition of chinese mothers , piling food onto my plate , urging me to “ eat more , eat more. ” sure , there were occasions when serving chopsticks and spoons were used — like potlucks , for example , or meals with strangers . </s>  but at home and between friends , sharing was caring . </s>  eight years of living and eating out in china only served to reinforce the habit . </s>  but then came the new coronavirus . </s>  almost overnight , habits changed . </s>  for perhaps the first time , serving spoons and chopsticks appeared at our family ’ s lunar new year dinner . </s>  in beijing in march , during one of my first meals out after the city ’ s restriction began to loosen , my friend and i asked for serving chopsticks for each of the dishes we ordered . </s>  it felt strange at first , but we quickly got used to it . </s>  after the immediate threat of the virus fades , though , it remains to be seen whether or not these new habits will stick in china . </s>  as liu peng , 32 , an education consultant from the coastal city of qingdao , told me : “ maybe using serving chopsticks is more hygienic but eating is the time for us all to relax , and we don ’ t want to be bothered by all these little rules. ” reporting and research were contributed by donald g. mcneil jr. , frances robles , kirk semple , manuela andreoni , natalie kitroeff , concepción de

fashion institute of technology , i could have never imagined the unspeakable trauma i was about to watch unfold . </s>  in the ensuing days and weeks after 9/11 , as fashion week got canceled and talks of war got louder , a fundamental question bloomed in my mind . </s>  in a world that is so capable of hurting itself , what is the point of dedicating my life to pretty dresses ? </s>  pain has a way of shaping us . </s>  beauty has a way of speaking to us . </s>  but these messages and how they relate to each other are not always immediately obvious . </s>  as a young person , i couldn ’ t decipher exactly the purpose or direction of my dreams , yet i resolved at least to not be driven by fear . </s>  i hoped for my work to cultivate human connection . </s>  i plowed _forward as if called by an invisible force , holding onto a faith that someday perhaps the pieces would fit together . </s>  after college and a few years of being chewed up by the garment industry , a series of life events forced me to stop and reimagine my entire career . </s>  i found myself more humbled than ever , and my only remaining motivation was the deep love of the craft that i had known as a child at my mother ’ s feet . </s>  cautiously , i started making simple wedding dresses out of my brooklyn apartment . </s>  [ sign up for love letter and always get the latest in modern love , weddings ,

. </s>  i had been caught up in that whirlwind before , and found myself married by the age of 23 . </s>  for a decade i struggled mightily to make our relationship work , but ultimately it ended in heartbreak . </s>  so perhaps , i didn ’ t believe i myself could be fully loved . </s>  yet i found myself fueled by a simple , viable hope : if i could dedicate myself to making beautiful things that bring me joy , some others out there may gain joy from them as well . </s>  perhaps in this way i could support myself and my two young sons and eventually give good jobs to a few others . </s>  a simple sharing of joy seemed a worthwhile pursuit . </s>  armed with nothing more than this vision , a few hundred dollars of savings , my training , and a whole lot of grit , my tiny business miraculously flourished . </s>  as i used my skills to help women to feel their most beautiful , symbiotically each bride helped me to discover the connection and inspiration i had been seeking for so long . </s>  the encouragement my brides poured over me — as an individual and as a designer — helped me to believe again that i , too , was worthy of all kinds of love . </s>  and with this healing , i began to open myself up to the possibility of meeting the right kind of life partner . </s>  when i serendipitously met michael peppard last year , there was no way i could have guessed that soon i would find myself completely in love — and later in pandemic-induced lockdown — with him . </s>  yet that is exactly what happened . </s>  for once in my life , i feel seen and accepted , loved for all of me . </s>  just nine months after we met , we decided to marry . </s>  our excitement could not be bound up by lengthy lead times , familial interjections , and detailed planning . </s>  we felt somewhat urgently that we should be a family , to face together whatever life may bring . </s>  we knew we wanted to elope , and arranged plans to hold a sparkle-filled celebration with family and friends a few months later . </s>  we set our ceremony to take place on dec. 30 , 2019 , in the mountains of steamboat springs , colo. , the last spot we had camped during a memory-saturated summer road trip . </s>  we lined up our friend who is a colorado-based episcopal priest to officiate , booked a talented photographer friend to capture it , reserved an airbnb , found a wonderful day-of coordinator , and ordered some silk flowers off etsy . </s>  it felt wildly romantic to wrap up a perfect year of falling in love with our own kind of perfect ceremony . </s>  and it felt deeply satisfying to me , a person who is surrounded daily by stressed-out brides , to plan my own wedding in a matter of hours . </s>  date and details set , i figured making my gown would be no problem whatsoever . </s>  after all , i would love to wear any of the gowns i design ! </s>  but i felt nagged by the urge to be unique , to design something memorable and inspiring . </s>  what i love about a wedding gown is that it ’ s almost purely emotional and not at all practical . </s>  it ’ s a piece of interactive art . </s>  imagining a wedding gown as a way not to transform but to reveal a woman ’ s true beauty has provided me endless inspiration . </s>  however , when i turned my gaze to the mirror , it became cripplingly difficult to decide how exactly to dress myself . </s>  with endless design options and only a few short months to execute it , my head swirled . </s>  i imagined a free-formed tulle skirt in layers of deep purples and magenta , paired with a long-sleeved bodysuit ecstatically embroidered with a rainbow of floral motifs . </s>  or perhaps i would craft a sweeping emerald green satin gown , encrusted with museum-worthy beadwork . </s>  i was fairly certain at the time that i would not wear ivory or white — frankly , after making several thousand white gowns , i salivated for a fresh palette . </s>  decision fatigue and information overload can be problems for most brides . </s>  in my case , the paralysis became quite real . </s>  i also started feeling acutely aware that i would want to share my photos on social media for my brand — and that i had not hit the gym in months . </s>  there came a morning just one month before our elopement when i had to give myself the same “ talk ” i often give my clients : breathe . </s>  reduce the noise , focus on your vows , keep the energy around your gown light . </s>  and for god ’ s sake , woman , don ’ t think of your wedding as an instagram photo shoot ! </s>  with my newfound peace of mind , i decided to make my gown out of materials i already owned . </s>  i gravitated toward a length of ivory french lace that i had used for my debut collection and still love dearly . </s>  i opted to create a streamlined silhouette referencing the western pioneer women of the late 1800s , who were my ancestors . </s>  my brooklyn team deftly tailored the custom sleeves , which we added to our signature sheath shape . </s>  i finished off the look with an ivory organza overskirt i borrowed from my shop and a custom veil and accessories created by close industry friends . </s>  i love what i wore , but much more important i love that i am now married to my best friend . </s>  i ’ m utterly grateful that we have each other to lean on through these very hard times . </s>  i ’ m

as the coronavirus was rapidly spreading , npr ’ s “ weekend all things considered ” carried excerpts from sermons from across the country . </s>  i was particularly touched by the way presiding bishop michael curry ended his talk at washington national cathedral , singing , “ he ’ s got the whole world in his hands , he ’ s got the whole world in his hands . </s>  … ” it was a powerful close that left me thinking : just substitute “ she ” for “ he ” and you ’ ve defined the core problem we ’ re facing . </s>  for the first time in the life of our generation of human species , mother nature has the whole world in her hands . </s>  the entire planet is collectively facing the same challenges from the same coronavirus at the same time . </s>  that has been the starting point of all my analyses . </s>  i try to ground all my thoughts on how to deal with this pandemic in the logic of mother nature and the laws of natural systems . </s>  if you don ’ t — if instead you start your analysis with politics or ideology , or the fact that you ’ re just tired of being locked down so what the hell , let ’ s throw back a few with the gang at the local bar and the virus be damned — you ’ re actually challenging mother nature to a duel . </s>  and no one seems to be doing that more these days than president trump , who ’ s practically been sounding the all-clear lately , mother nature ’ s powers be damned . </s>  i understand how people are desperate to save their businesses and get their salaries back . </s>  anyone reading this column knows my heart has been with them from the start . </s>  but if you define wearing a mask , or restrictions on the size of religious gatherings , as a sign of disrespect for your personal freedom — not an act of respect for mother nature when she has the whole world in her hands — you ’ re making a huge mistake . </s>  let ’ s remember , mother nature is just chemistry , biology and physics , and the engine that drives her is one thing : natural selection . </s>  that is the quest of all organisms , to survive and thrive in some ecological niche as they engage in the struggle to pass on their dna to their next generation and not end up among those that get returned to the manufacturer and decommissioned . </s>  and that ’ s what viruses do , too : try to survive and replicate . </s>  the coronavirus , for instance , co-evolved with bats in the wild . </s>  but it apparently jumped to humans when someone ate an infected mammal in wuhan , china . </s>  when it did , it made a warm home in human cells and tissues in ways that can harm or kill us . </s>  once that happened , the coronavirus became just another one of mother nature ’ s fastballs that she throws at us to see who ’ s the fittest . </s>  mother nature is not only all powerful , she ’ s also unfeeling . </s>  unlike that merciful god that most humans worship , mother nature doesn ’ t keep score . </s>  she can inflict her virus on your grandmother on monday and blow down your house with a tornado on wednesday and come back on friday and flood your basement . </s>  she can hit you in the spring , give you a warm hug in summer and hammer you in the fall . </s>  as such , telling her that you ’ re fed up with being locked down — that it ’ s enough already ! </s>  — doesn ’ t actually register with her . </s>  all that registers , all that she rewards , is one thing : adaptation . </s>  she doesn ’ t reward the richest or the strongest or the smartest of the species . </s>  she rewards the most adaptive . </s>  they get to pass along their dna . </s>  and in a pandemic , that means she rewards a president , governor , mayor or citizen who , first and foremost , respects her power . </s>  if you don ’ t respect her viruses , wildfires , droughts , hurricanes , floods and so on , she will hurt you or your neighbors or your citizens . </s>  president trump doesn ’ t respect mother nature , because he measures everything in terms of money and markets . </s>  he has no feel for natural systems , except golf courses , where he developed the illusion that he could tame nature , even building man-made waterfalls . </s>  mother nature also rewards leaders whose adaptive responses are the most thought-through and coordinated . </s>  she evolved her viruses to be expert at finding any weakness in your personal or communal immune system . </s>  so , if your family or community is not utterly coordinated in its response to her viruses , they will find the tiniest cracks and make you pay . </s>  also , because mother nature is entirely made up of chemistry , biology and physics , she rewards only adaptation strategies grounded in those same raw materials . </s>  if your adaptation strategy is grounded instead in ideology or election-year politics , she will mercilessly expose that . </s>  and remember , mother nature will not stop spreading this virus until either we come up with a vaccine to give us herd immunity or some 60 percent of us get the infection , overcome it naturally , and develop herd immunity that way . </s>  but her viruses don ’ t just magically disappear because of lockdowns . </s>  it is true that the coronavirus hits different regions , climates and populations differently , and so each should be able to adapt a little differently . </s>  but as university of minnesota epidemiologist michael osterholm recently told usa today , over time “ this damn virus is going to keep going until it infects everybody it possibly can ” — until it meets a vaccine or natural herd immunity . </s>  for all these reasons it ’ s clear , or should be , that the holy grail every nation needs to be looking for is what dr. david katz , a public health expert , argued from the beginning of this crisis : a “ sustainable strategy of total harm minimization. ” that means a strategy that would save as many lives and as many livelihoods as possible at the same time . </s>  we have to be trying our very best to do both , and we can . </s>  “ our choice never had to be accepting millions of deaths from the virus or from economic ruin , ” said katz . </s>  we could have , and still can , acknowledge that different members of our population face different risks from covid-19 “ and therefore develop strategies that protect the most vulnerable in our populations and let the least vulnerable return to work — and thus achieve the best of both ‘ lock it down ’ and ‘ open it up. ’ ” basically china , germany , south korea , sweden and many others have all been pursuing different strategies for sustainably and maximally saving lives and livelihoods . </s>  it is too soon to say that any of them has found the perfect strategy . </s>  but what it ’ s not too soon to say is that they are all reopening in ways that respect mother nature , appreciate the need for coordination and are grounded in science . </s>  so they ’ re still requiring some degree of wearing of masks in public , practicing social distancing , restricting the number of people who gather in any enclosed space , protecting the most vulnerable and limiting further spread by massive testing , tracing and quarantining to contain inevitable new outbreaks — until they get herd immunity . </s>  america , by contrast , is a mess . </s>  in some places you see reopenings that respect mother nature ’ s power , are coordinated and grounded in science , and in other places you see crowded restaurants or a gym owner defying his governor ’ s guidelines as cheering demonstrators wave signs that read “ my freedom doesn ’ t end where your fear begins. ” the people making those signs , and the morons on fox cheering them on , don ’ t get it . </s>  we ’ re not up against each other . </s>  we ’ re all up against mother nature . </s>  we need to reopen and we need to adapt , but in ways that honor mother nature ’ s logic , not in ways that court a second wave — not in ways that challenge mother nature to a duel . </s>  that is not smart . </s>  because she hasn ’ t lost a duel in 4.5 billion years . </s>  the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor . </s>  we ’ d like

decision to possibly send checks to all adults makes sense or not , but it is clear that not all americans need the money , $ 1,000 , or whatever it is . </s>  perhaps there is a way for those not in

oakton , va. to the editor : we would like to share an idea to help save our economy : every business should offer gift cards for sale at discounted prices . </s>  for example , united airlines sells a $ 100 credit for $ 80 . </s>  each company can decide the amount of discount based on how much cash is needed . </s>  the result would be that consumers inject cash into the economy for future consumption while staying at home and practicing social distancing , and businesses stay alive . </s>  in this way individual americans can provide a series of small “ loans ” to keep businesses going , and in return , when the crisis is over , those individuals are rewarded by receiving merchandise or services for less . </s>  extra funds available to businesses could hold them over for a few extra weeks or months , which could very well be the difference between bankruptcy and survival . </s>  michaela vargas mark vargas mammoth lakes , calif. to the editor : to secretary steven mnuchin ,

evidence that the coronavirus is impacting latinos , especially in certain states and communities , with particular force . </s>  other groups , including african-americans , also have been hard hit . </s>  but for doctors like eva galvez , who works as a family physician for a network of clinics in northwestern oregon , the disparity for latinos has become alarming . </s>  in tests of low-income patients over the past several weeks , she said , latinos were 20 times as likely as other patients to have the virus . </s>  oregon is just one of many states where latinos are showing a disproportionate level of impact . </s>  in iowa , latinos account for more than 20 percent of coronavirus cases though they are only 6 percent of the population . </s>  latinos in washington state make up 13 percent of the population but 31 percent of cases . </s>  in florida , hispanics are just over a quarter of the population but account for two of every five virus cases where the patient ’ s ethnicity is known . </s>  public health experts say latinos may be more vulnerable to the virus as a result of the same factors that have put minorities at risk across the country . </s>  many have low-paying service jobs that require them to work through the pandemic , interacting with the public . </s>  a large number also lack access to health care , which contributes to higher rates of diabetes and other conditions that can worsen infections . </s>  but the virus has not discriminated : its effects , experts said , had been seen among both immigrants and latinos from multigenerational american families in latino communities with a longer history in the united states — like those in arizona , california , new mexico and texas — the differences are narrower , at least according to the official data reported by the states . </s>  experts say one reason is that places with more established latino communities have a wider spectrum of professional and middle-class families with more wealth , who can work from home or take advantage of other options for weathering the pandemic . </s>  now , though , officials worry that those disparities could grow as the annual harvest season begins this month and seasonal farmworkers flood into states already seeing large differences in infection rates . </s>  in oregon , officials are scrambling to enact far-ranging changes to work rules and living conditions for migrant workers , fearing that without them the virus could sweep through the 160,000 workers who typically toil in the fields , eat and bunk in proximity . </s>  trump ’ s travel restrictions didn ’ t result in rigorous screening in u.s. airports . </s>  president trump ’ s go-to defense of his early response to the coronavirus is his decision to close down travel from china , the virus ’ s original center , and then from ravaged europe . </s>  but those hasty decisions led to exoduses of american citizens , packed airports and , according to a new congressional report , very few rigorous screenings for passengers who could have been bringing the virus home with them . </s>  medical officials on contract from the department of homeland security checked the temperatures of just 10 percent of the more than 250,000 travelers who got some screening when they arrived at u.s. airports from travel-restricted countries during a 10-week span from january to march , according to a report released thursday by the house oversight and reform committee . </s>  the finding raised questions about one of the centerpieces of mr. trump ’ s argument that his administration responded aggressively to contain the outbreak . </s>  if customs officers noticed symptoms in travelers returning from restricted countries , they were told to refer them to federal or local medical officials at the airport for more screening . </s>  but officials from the countering weapons of mass destruction office , which is part of the homeland security agency , told the committee that the informal policy was to check one of every 10 passengers because they “ don ’ t want to slow things down , ” according to the report . </s>  and they said that just under 1,500 arriving passengers were passed along for more rigorous screening by officials with the centers for disease control and prevention between jan. 17 and march 29 . </s>  a report paints a scathing picture of a new jersey nursing home . </s>  one patient was found dead in bed , 12 hours after falling on a wet floor and sustaining a head injury . </s>  sick residents who were awaiting the results of coronavirus tests shared rooms with healthy residents . </s>  since march , at least 53 have died after testing positive . </s>  those were among the findings of a federal inspection last month of a northern new jersey nursing home , andover subacute and rehabilitation center ii , that is now the site of one of the state ’ s largest outbreaks . </s>  the report , released on thursday by the centers for medicare and medicaid services , offers the first detailed glimpse into how the pandemic has ravaged nursing homes across the country . </s>  it was released on the same day that members of the national guard arrived in andover , n.j. , to assist at the nursing home , a 543-bed facility that has been chronically short of staff members and masks and has over the past two years received poor grades from federal and state inspectors . </s>  nursing homes have been hit particularly hard by the outbreak . </s>  a tally by the times found that more than 118,000 residents and staff members at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have contracted the virus , and more than 19,600 have died . </s>  but a separate times investigation also found that , when the pandemic struck , a majority of the nation ’ s nursing homes were losing money , some were falling into disrepair , and others were struggling to attract new occupants . </s>  their troubled state was years in the making . </s>  decades of ownership by private equity and other private investment firms left many nursing homes with staggering bills and razor-thin margins , while competition from home care attendants and assisted-living facilities further gutted their business . </s>  even so , many of their owners still found creative ways to wring profits out of them , according to an analysis of federal and state data . </s>  most states that are reopening fail to meet white house guidelines while the trump administration ’ s recommendation ultimately leaves states ’ fates to governors , most reopening states fail to meet the criteria for a downward trend in reported coronavirus cases . </s>  white house staff members will be tested daily after an aide tests positive . </s>  president trump said on thursday that he and vice president mike pence , as well as the white house staff , would be tested every day for the coronavirus after a military aide who has had contact with the president was found to have the virus . </s>  asked by reporters about the aide , whom a senior administration official described as a personal valet to the president , mr. trump played down the matter . </s>  “ i ’ ve had very little contact , personal contact , with this gentleman , ” he said . </s>  but he added that he and other officials and staff members at the white house would be tested more frequently . </s>  a white house spokesman said that mr. trump and mr. pence had both tested negative for the virus since their exposure to the aide . </s>  but the episode raised new questions about how well-protected mr. trump and other top officials are as they work at the white house , typically without wearing masks . </s>  the president has said that the white house uses a test kit made by abbott , which can return results on the spot in as little as five minutes . </s>  but health professionals have warned that the abbott test kit produces less reliable results than those shipped to labs but which can take days . </s>  the military aide ’ s illness was first reported by cnn , and was made public the day before eight world war ii veterans — each older than 95 , an age group at high statistical risk for serious illness from the coronavirus — were scheduled to take part in a photo-op at the white house and an event at the world war ii memorial nearby to celebrate the 75th anniversary on friday of the german surrender , known as v-e day . </s>  the event will include an opportunity for the veterans to take pictures at the white house with the secretaries of defense and state ; the first lady , melania trump ; and the president , according to a schedule prepared by the greatest generations foundation , which organized the event . </s>  in new york , race is seen as a factor in social distancing enforcement . </s>  tensions are flaring in black and hispanic neighborhoods in new york over the enforcement of social distancing rules , leading some prominent elected officials to charge that the new york police department is engaging in a racist double standard as it struggles to shift to a public health role in the pandemic . </s>  the arrests of black and hispanic residents , several of them filmed and posted online , occurred on the same balmy days as other photographs showing police officers handing out masks to mostly white visitors at parks in lower manhattan , williamsburg and long island city . </s>  on thursday , the brooklyn district attorney ’ s office became the first prosecutor in the city to release statistics on social distancing enforcement . </s>  in the borough , the police arrested 40 people for social distancing violations from march 17 through may 4 , the district attorney ’ s office said . </s>  of those arrested , 35 people were black , four were hispanic and one was white . </s>  more than a third of the arrests were made in the predominantly black neighborhood of brownsville , while no one was arrested in the more white neighborhood of park slope . </s>  the tension over the enforcement of social distancing measures came as new york city ’ s mayor said on thursday that the city might begin limiting entry to some parks to prevent overcrowding as the weather warms . </s>  he did not clarify which parks but said more details would be provided on friday . </s>  economists predict a depression-era unemployment rate . </s>  with unemployment claims surpassing 33 million since march , the nation ’ s near-term economic outlook hinges on whether patchwork reopenings can mend the damage from the pandemic — and how soon . </s>  nearly 3.2 million americans were added to state jobless rolls last week , the labor department said thursday , and economists expect the monthly jobs

have full-time jobs for them and how quickly customers will return to the shopping and spending habits that stoke the consumer-driven economy . </s>  at the same time , many employers may not survive , particularly small ones , while others are likely to operate with reduced hours and staff members . </s>  most americans are uneasy about the moves to reopen , with 67 percent saying they would be uncomfortable going into a store and 78 percent saying they would be uncomfortable eating at a restaurant , according to a survey that the washington post and the university of maryland released this

united states carrier to announce plans to take passengers ’ temperatures before boarding commercial flights , the latest effort to make travel safer as parts of the american economy continue to reopen . </s>  beginning june 1 , anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher will be denied boarding , frontier said . </s>  the requirement came as several major transit agencies and facilities also announced measures to limit the spread of virus . </s>  amtrak said it would require passengers to wear face coverings in stations and on trains and buses starting monday . </s>  the coverings can be removed only when passengers are eating in designated areas , in private rooms or when seated alone or with a companion in their own pair of seats , amtrak said . </s>  the los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority said that it would also require riders on buses and trains to wear face coverings beginning monday . </s>  its announcement came one day after los angeles international airport said that , starting monday , it would require anyone in its terminals to wear a face covering . </s>  some los angeles transportation workers had urged the agency to make face coverings mandatory as it prepared to restore bus and rail service . </s>  at least 58 agency employees or contractors , including 16 bus drivers , have tested test positive for the virus .

coronavirus : nearly everyone who has had the disease — regardless of age , sex or severity of illness — eventually makes antibodies . </s>  antibodies are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens . </s>  typically , these proteins confer protection against the invader . </s>  several countries , including the united states , are hoping that antibody tests — flawed though many may be — can help decide who is immune to the virus and can return to work . </s>  people who are immune could replace vulnerable individuals , especially in high-transmission settings , building in the population what researchers call shield immunity . </s>  the new study also eased a worry that only some people — those who were severely ill , for example — might make antibodies . </s>  in fact , the level of antibodies did not differ by age or sex , the researchers found , and even people who had only mild symptoms produced a healthy amount . </s>  “ the question now becomes to what extent those are neutralizing antibodies , and whether that leads to protection from infection — all of which we should presume are yes , ” said sean whelan , a virologist at washington university in st. louis . </s>  the white house and the c.d.c . </s>  clash over reopening guidelines . </s>  as mr. trump rushes to reopen the economy , a battle has erupted between the white house and the centers for

restaurants , closing every other row of seats in buses and subways while restricting transit routes between areas experiencing different infection levels , and separating children at school and camps into groups that should not mix throughout the day . </s>  but white house and other administration officials rejected the recommendations over concerns that they were overly prescriptive , infringed on religious rights and risked further damaging an economy that mr. trump was banking on to recover quickly . </s>  a spokesman for the c.d.c . </s>  said the guidance was still under discussion with the white house , and a revised version could be published soon . </s>  the rejection of the guidelines is the latest confusing signal as the trump administration struggles to balance mr. trump ’ s desire to reopen the country quickly against the advice of public health experts , who have counseled reopening methodically via steps tied to reduced rates of infection and expanded efforts to control the spread of the virus . </s>  more than half the states have begun to reopen their economies or plan to do so soon , but most fail to meet the criteria recommended by the trump administration . </s>  in more than half of the states that are easing restrictions , case counts are trending upward , positive test results are on the rise , or both , raising concerns among public health experts . </s>  a drug promoted by trump neither helped nor harmed patients , researchers find . </s>  hydroxychloroquine , the malaria drug frequently promoted by mr. trump , neither helped nor harmed coronavirus patients at newyork-presbyterian columbia university irving medical center in manhattan , researchers reported . </s>  as a result , the hospital is no longer recommending it as a treatment for its covid-19 patients . </s>  the authors of the report , in the new england journal of medicine , say the drug should be used only in controlled clinical trials where patients are picked at random to receive one treatment or another . </s>  controlled trials , which are underway around the world , are the most reliable way of finding out whether a drug works . </s>  in the last several weeks , federal agencies and medical societies have issued safety warnings about hydroxychloroquine and the closely related drug chloroquine . </s>  the food and drug administration said last month that the drugs could cause dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities in coronavirus patients and should be used only in clinical trials or hospitals where patients can be closely monitored . </s>  the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases issued a similar warning , saying there was “ insufficient data ” to recommend the drugs . </s>  the new study did not include information on tests of heart rhythm . </s>  hydroxychloroquine is approved to treat malaria and the autoimmune diseases lupus and rheumatoid arthritis . </s>  but anecdotal reports from china and france early in the epidemic suggested that it might also help fight the coronavirus . </s>  with no proven treatment , doctors around the world began using it in a desperate effort to save dying patients , and mr. trump suggested people should take it . </s>  but there is little evidence to support its continued use against the virus , and the french report was later discredited . </s>  california expects a $

stay-at-home order through may 28 . </s>  but on thursday she moved to allow some manufacturers to bring back their workers next week , paving the way for the auto industry to resume production . </s>  major auto companies have been hoping to restart most of their manufacturing operations by may 18 , which will require others in the supply chain to resume work earlier . </s>  nearly 20,000 teenagers in georgia are issued driver ’ s licenses without a road test . </s>  the road test is a rite of passage for millions of american teenagers . </s>  but last month , georgia waived that requirement for most drivers to help fight the spread of the virus . </s>  the state said this week that it had issued licenses to nearly 20,000 teenagers without requiring road tests . </s>  “ these

warfare in ohio is part of a growing rebellion by republican legislators across the country against their governors — both democratic and republican — arguing that stay-at-home orders and nonessential business closures are smothering the economy and violating rights . </s>  republicans in pennsylvania tried in late april to overturn the democratic governor ’ s stay-at-home order . </s>  in louisiana , republicans voted to strip the governor of his administration ’ s ability to penalize businesses for violating such an order . </s>  in wisconsin and michigan , republican lawmakers sued

to american hospitals and distributed to others on the front line of the outbreak . </s>  but starting in mid-april , tests conducted by the c.d.c . </s>  revealed that some of the products did not

that the u.s. airline industry will emerge a shadow of what it was on march 1 of this year , ” mr. calio said . </s>  that did not satisfy democrats who said the industry ’ s practices around refunds were misleading or deceptive . </s>  many airlines have been encouraging travelers to take vouchers for future travel instead of cash . </s>  here ’ s what this week ’ s jobs data will show . </s>  government figures due friday will undoubtedly show that job losses in april were the worst ever . </s>  but they could provide key hints about the recovery . </s>  economists surveyed by marketwatch expect the labor department report to show that u.s. payrolls fell by 22 million jobs last month — a decade ’ s worth of job gains , wiped out in weeks . </s>  the payroll processing company adp on wednesday said that the private sector lost more than 20 million jobs in april , with the cuts spread across every sector and size of employer . </s>  it ’ s no surprise that employers have cut millions of jobs . </s>  weekly data on filings for unemployment benefits , released every thursday , have tracked the destruction . </s>  but the monthly numbers due on friday are more comprehensive than the weekly ones , which almost certainly understate the damage . </s>  friday ’ s report could also help answer a question that could be crucial to the eventual recovery : how far has the damage spread ? </s>  if the losses are concentrated in sectors that have been directly affected by the virus , like retail and services that were hit by stay-at-home orders , that could bode well for the recovery , because it suggests the damage has been contained . </s>  but if it has spread to industries like finance and professional services , that could suggest a cascade effect is underway , with laid-off workers pulling back on spending , leading to lost revenues and still more layoffs . </s>  it could take much longer to climb out of that kind of hole . </s>  white house officials say

of hamburgers , while costco and kroger have put limits on the number of meat items customers can purchase . </s>  the trump administration issued an executive order last week to put more pressure on

pressing the government this week for billions of dollars in emergency aid as the coronavirus crisis crushes the travel business . </s>  with congress debating how to help the ailing united states economy , decisions like these could have long-term implications for climate change , too . </s>  the nation ’ s major airlines recently asked for $ 50 billion in government assistance , warning that they could soon go bankrupt otherwise . </s>  president trump has endorsed such an aid package , though the idea may prove contentious . </s>  on wednesday , eight senate democrats signed a letter saying that any aid to airlines ( or cruise ships , for that matter ) should come with conditions requiring them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over time . </s>  “ if we give the airline and cruise industries assistance without requiring them to be better environmental stewards , we would miss a major opportunity to combat climate change and ocean dumping , ” read the letter , signed by senator sheldon whitehouse , democrat of rhode island , along with seven of his colleagues . </s>  air travel has become an increasingly important contributor to global warming . </s>  while aviation still accounts for less than 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions , those emissions are expected to triple by 2050 as tourism and travel expand . </s>  and airlines have struggled to clean up their act : in recent years , air traffic in the united states has grown three times as fast as the rate of fuel-efficiency improvements . </s>  some climate experts point out that lawmakers have plenty of options to change that dynamic if they wish , particularly if taxpayers are being asked to save the industry . </s>  one possible model is the 2009 bailout of the auto industry , which nearly collapsed during the financial meltdown a decade ago . </s>  the obama administration rescued gm and chrysler from bankruptcy but also enacted stricter new fuel-economy rules for cars and light trucks . </s>  ( more recently , the trump administration has been working to relax those rules . ) </s>  daniel rutherford , who directs the aviation and marine programs at the international council on clean transportation , offered a few ideas on twitter for what a climate-friendly bailout of the airlines might look like . </s>  congress could require new efficiency rules or even offer airlines tax breaks to speed up the retirement of older , more polluting aircraft in favor of newer , cleaner models . </s>  or , airlines could be required to publicly report the emissions that result from different itineraries so that travelers can more easily choose less-polluting flights . </s>  “ the focus right now is on saving jobs and preventing a deep recession , and that should be front and center , ” mr. rutherford said . </s>  “ but air travel is eventually going to bounce back after this crisis subsides . </s>  and if the industry gets bailed out without any change to the underlying

challenger , benny gantz , agreed monday night to establish a unity government , a deal that finally breaks a yearlong political impasse and keeps mr. netanyahu in office as he faces trial on corruption charges . </s>  after three inconclusive elections in the past year , the creation of the new government forestalls what had appeared to be an inevitable fourth election and offers a deeply divided israel a chance for national healing as it battles the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  for mr. netanyahu , the agreement buys him time to try to resolve two contentious issues central to his legacy : to sidestep his prosecution or at least prevent it from driving him from power , and to extend israeli sovereignty over occupied territory . </s>  the deal , announced by both men ’ s political parties at 7:15 p.m. , adds to mr. netanyahu ’ s tenure as israel ’ s longest-serving leader and , coming after his conservative coalition failed to win a majority , cements his reputation as a canny political survivor who can never be counted out . </s>  for mr. gantz , a former army chief and relative political novice , however , the agreement may have the opposite effect . </s>  the move was a stunning turnabout after his repeated campaign vows that he would never serve with a prime minister under criminal indictment , and a disappointment to many of his supporters who saw it as a capitulation to a leader they had wanted to oust . </s>  under the deal , which the two leaders cast as an emergency government to fight the coronavirus , mr. gantz will be named deputy prime minister and is to get a turn as prime minister halfway through their three-year term , in october 2021 , switching roles with mr. netanyahu . </s>  but given mr. netanyahu ’ s political cunning , israeli analysts were skeptical that he would hand over power when the time came — or even that the new government would last that long . </s>  mr. gantz won at least a measure of insurance : their rotation agreement would require 75 of the 120 members of parliament to vote to overturn it , and if the government is disbanded early he would become prime minister . </s>  but mr. netanyahu , whose trial on bribery , fraud and breach of trust charges is now set to begin may 24 , will have an effective veto over appointments of the next attorney general and state prosecutor . </s>  mr. netanyahu had also sought an assurance — which he did not achieve — that if the supreme court rules that a criminal defendant can not serve as prime minister , the new government would pass legislation overriding such a decision . </s>  but mr. netanyahu did win a clause saying that such a decision by the court in the next six months would immediately lead to new elections . </s>  mr. netanyahu could then try again for a 61-seat majority that would enact the override he would need to retain power . </s>  anshel pfeffer , a biographer of mr. netanyahu , said he expected that , rather than try to torpedo the deal when mr. gantz ’ s turn comes as prime minister mr. netanyahu had reason to protect it because he is still assured of one of the top two jobs in israel . </s>  “ he ’ s not only won this , he ’ s bought gantz ’ s services as a bodyguard , ” mr. pfeffer said . </s>  “ gantz is bound to protect bibi , because it ’ s the only way he becomes prime minister , ” he said , using mr. netanyahu ’ s nickname . </s>  “ and for the next three years , bibi can go on trial , they can say the most terrible things about him in court , and he can lose , but until he loses his last appeal , he ’ s protected , ” mr. pfeffer said . </s>  despite the sense of urgency to form a joint government to fight the virus sweeping through the country , the final sticking points in the negotiations were political . </s>  according to representatives of mr. gantz ’ s centrist blue and white party , they included differing approaches to president trump ’ s proposal to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict : mr. netanyahu has pledged to swiftly and unilaterally annex large swaths of the occupied west bank while mr. gantz has said he would support annexation only with international consensus , which appears highly unlikely . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates updated jan. 27 , 2021 , 8:53 p.m . </s>  et whitmer pleads with michigan lawmakers to find

the needs for preserving regional stability , protecting existing peace agreements and aspiring for future ones. ” but it leaves those determinations up to the government and says that mr. gantz is only entitled to “ consultation ” with mr. netanyahu on annexation , not a veto . </s>  the two-month delay gives opponents of annexation , who say it would reignite the conflict and deal a death blow to already dim hopes of a two-state solution , a brief window to build international and domestic support to try to block such a move . </s>  “ a government coalition based on a commitment to annex more occupied palestinian territory is a threat to a rules-based world order in general , but to peace , security and stability in the middle east in particular , ” saeb erekat , the veteran palestinian negotiator , said in a statement . </s>  “ annexation means the end of any possibility for a negotiated solution. ” the deal between mr. gantz and mr. netanyahu first envisions an emergency government lasting for six months , when only legislation related to the battle against the coronavirus can be taken up by parliament — except for bills concerning the trump plan , the two sides said . </s>  a “ coronavirus cabinet ” will be formed , jointly led by mr. netanyahu and mr. gantz , to coordinate efforts . </s>  the trump administration plan , announced in january , gives israel most of what it has sought over decades of conflict while offering the palestinians a state with limited sovereignty . </s>  under the plan , israel would control a unified jerusalem as its capital and would not be required to uproot any west bank settlements . </s>  for now , it offers a vital lifeline to mr. netanyahu , who can fight his corruption trial from the prime minister ’ s

vitriolic attacks by mr. netanyahu and his supporters on the police and the judiciary . </s>  despite mr. gantz ’ s vows to protect the judiciary , his former partner in blue and white , yair lapid , noted scornfully that mr. netanyahu had come away with control over a key committee that oversees the appointment of supreme court judges , who must retire at 70 . </s>  “ so the compromise in the judge-appointing committee is that bibi chose all of the committee ’ s representatives , ” mr. lapid wrote on twitter . </s>  mr. gantz , he added , had “ agreed to allow the criminal defendant to

and his allies did at first agree to try to deny mr. netanyahu yet another term , either by enacting term limits or by passing a law to bar an indicted lawmaker from forming a government . </s>  those

</s>    london — noël coward wrote “ blithe spirit ” in a mere six days , and the perennially popular play opened on the west end in 1941 , running for nearly 2,000 performances — setting a record in london for a nonmusical . </s>  its longevity back then is in stark contrast with the most recent outing of the play here , with jennifer saunders , of “ absolutely fabulous ” fame , playing the bicycle-riding medium madame arcati , who communicates with the dead . </s>  a victim of circumstances beyond the control of even the most supernaturally minded , the director richard eyre ’ s

from pneumonia , which may well have had an eerie resonance for nervous playgoers today . ) </s>  when she rises up , the mischievous elvira ( emma naomi ) scatters calculated chaos in her wake . </s>  it ’ s giving nothing away to tell you that she ends up taking charles ’ s second wife , the whiplash-tongued ruth ( lisa dillon , giving the performance of the night ) , over to the other side with her , though neither woman will go quietly from the land of the living . </s>  this was easily the least buoyant “ blithe spirit ” i ’ ve seen , which was presumably intentional on the part of eyre , the distinguished director who once ran the national theater . </s>  the trend of late has been to find in coward ’ s outwardly breezy plays something more psychologically acute , as was the case when andrew scott , of “ fleabag ” fame , stormed the old vic last summer in “ present laughter . ” against expectation , a character long presented as a devil-may-care narcissist was revealed to be an anxious man-child , as well . </s>  both revivals remind us that coward possessed a keen understanding of human behavior , in addition to a quick wit . </s>  in this “ blithe spirit , ” charles and ruth ’ s marriage seems far from blissful well before elvira arrives on the scene , and eyre takes the verbal brickbats they lob at each other for real . </s>  this , like “ present laughter , ” is a coward play centered around a man who draws women to him when he would rather be left alone : both plays end with their flustered heroes fleeing female companionship , but for what precisely ? </s>  coward leaves the sequels up for grabs . </s>  the fate of this show , however , is sealed — though no one could have guessed how quickly it would flit from view . </s>  think of the cast as the casualties of an invisible terror . </s>  it was one that saunders , top-billed albeit in a supporting role that judi dench is playing in a forthcoming film , acknowledged when madame arcati — a germaphobe before her time — reacted in spontaneous disgust at shaking another character ’ s hand . </s>  i doubt those who laughed at that gesture last week would do so now . </s>  across london last

is entirely unclear when any of us will find ourselves in a london playhouse again . </s>  the audience that night had seemed especially focused , as if everyone present was savoring for keeps the experience of live performance . </s>  taking an empty underground train home , i couldn ’ t help but feel that jamie and cathy ’ s unraveling had acquired a resonance well beyond what the

affects large , elite hospital systems like the mayo clinic and johns hopkins — which estimates a loss of nearly $ 300 million into next year and has adopted cost reductions — as well as suburban hospitals and small rural facilities that were already financially stressed . </s>  lifespan health , a five-hospital system in rhode island , has put off planned construction of a new spine health center . </s>  in rural wyoming , the 12-bed weston county health services hospital has only enough cash available to get through 16 days , half of what it typically kept , and executives are considering closing the emergency room . </s>  hospitals that treated high numbers of coronavirus patients say they have been hit especially hard , as they had to spend heavily on protective equipment and increased staffing just as their most profitable services were halted . </s>  these patients often had long stays in intensive care units , requiring expensive equipment like ventilators and treatment from multiple specialists . </s>  “ we began ordering everything at a feverish pace , ” said kenneth raske , president of the greater new york hospital association . </s>  “ the costs were sometimes 10 or 20 times normal . </s>  we were scrounging all over the world for supplies. ” his organization estimates that , across new york city , large academic medical centers lost between $ 350 million and $ 450 million each last month . </s>  unlike hospitals fighting smaller coronavirus outbreaks , they could not furlough workers to offset the decline . </s>  “ in terms of taking care of patients , our hospitals did the right thing , ” mr. raske said . </s>  “ but the right thing has challenged their ability to continue sustaining themselves. ” the decline in revenue is expected to be especially high among hospitals that have commanded high prices from private health plans , like the mayo clinic . </s>  though coronavirus patients make up a small fraction of its patients — about 1,500 in a health system that sees more than a million annually — the global pandemic is upending its finances . </s>  last year , the clinic generated 60 percent of its $ 11.6 billion annual patient revenue from privately insured patients and 3 percent from those on medicaid , according to its annual financial statement . </s>  the rest were either covered by medicare or paid their own costs .

other hospitals , including those in low-income areas or with less recognizable brands , rely more heavily on medicaid funds . </s>  this includes many academic medical centers in large cities that see a high number of patients from their surrounding neighborhoods . </s>  at the johns hopkins hospital , a quarter of patient revenue comes from the public program , according to data provided by the nonprofit rand corporation . </s>  at newyork-presbyterian , it accounts for 16 percent of insurer payments . </s>  a nonprofit database shows that minnesota ’ s private insurers pay the mayo clinic $ 566 for each obstetric ultrasound , approximately five times the medicaid price . </s>  for an echocardiogram , the difference is tenfold . </s>  at mayo clinic centers in florida and wisconsin , according to rand estimates , insurers pay three to four times the medicare prices for outpatient care . </s>  similar data for inpatient prices is not publicly available . </s>  the minnesota-based hospital system promotes its services to well-off patients , delivering quality health care alongside luxury amenities such as hotel-like suites with fluffy bathrobes , private dining rooms and access to chef-cooked meals . </s>  “ they ’ ve really made a conscious effort to bolster their commercial contracts , and it ’ s a survival strategy , ” said lynn blewett , a professor of health policy and management at the university of minnesota . </s>  “ to maintain the quality and the research and the excellence they ’ re known for , they ’ ve got to bring in revenue . </s>  there isn ’ t a lot of margin , if any , with medicaid. ” more so than most other hospitals , the 131-year-old mayo clinic sees a significant number of patients from afar . </s>  in a typical year , more than a million patients travel to the system ’ s 21 hospitals from all 50 states and 140 countries . </s>  many are seen at its 2,000-bed rochester , minn. , campus . </s>  international patients generally account for 1.3 percent of hospital patients but closer to 3 percent of revenue because of the complex care they receive , a spokeswoman said . </s>  the clinic has used its past strong earnings to expand services abroad , opening a facility in london last fall , and now building a 741-bed for-profit institution in abu dhabi , in the united arab emirates . </s>  during the last recession of 2008 , nonprofit hospitals saw their medicaid revenue increase 17 percent , according to the credit ratings firm moody ’ s , a possible preview of the changes to come in the present downturn . </s>  minnesota expects to enroll an additional 100,000 residents in medicaid next year . </s>  nationally , the nonprofit urban institute projects between eight million and 15 million new medicaid enrollments among those losing the private insurance they had through employers . </s>  an additional five million to 10 million americans who lose such plans are expected to become uninsured , and four million to eight million will transition to the affordable care act ’ s individual market plans or other sources of private insurance . </s>  the mayo clinic expects to see more publicly insured patients in the second half of 2020 , although it has not recorded an uptick yet . </s>  mr. dahlen , the chief financial officer , said , “ we ’ ll probably see a richer mix of locals and people coming from within 100 miles. ” like other large successful health systems , the clinic has strong cash reserves and access to credit markets . </s>  it plans to convert its shortfall by dipping into the $ 10.6 billion reserve of cash and investments it has built up over decades of profitability . </s>  independent hospitals that already teetered on the edge have less of a financial cushion and are at greater risk of shutting down services or closing altogether . </s>  kalispell regional medical center in northwest montana has already seen a 1 percent increase in medicaid enrollees as patients begin to trickle back into the hospital last month . </s>  that shift from private insurance to public insurance represents a loss of $ 600,000 because of lower reimbursements , said craig boyer , the hospital ’ s chief financial officer . </s>  the hospital has experienced steep revenue declines after canceling most surgeries and seeing a 34 percent drop in emergency room visits . </s>  kalispell treated a small number of coronavirus patients , including 37 who tested positive and four admitted to the hospital . </s>  “ if you are a patient who was scheduled for a total knee replacement , you might say , ‘ my knee hurts but i ’ m still going to put it off while i see what happens , ’ ” mr. boyer said . </s>  “ we know there is a backlog , but we don ’ t know how many people are going to decide this isn ’ t the right time. ” he also worries that a lull in summer travel will depress revenue . </s>  his hospital typically sees more patients then as visitors flock to glacier national park , 30 miles away . </s>  the hospital has received $ 10.3 million in federal stimulus plans but does not expect that to cover its losses . </s>  in neighboring wyoming , the 90-bed campbell county memorial hospital , which treated 29 coronavirus cases with no deaths , has also been hit hard . </s>  “ the last six weeks have been disastrous for us , ” said andy fitzgerald , the chief executive . </s>  “ we ’ ve taken a 50 percent haircut on our revenue , and it ’ s the best 50 percent : elective surgery , radiology , all the outpatient care that pays for the other services we provide. ” local coal-mining companies , long a pillar of the economy , recently laid off hundreds of workers as global energy demands have declined . </s>  mr. fitzgerald expects that will mean a surge in the uninsured , who already account for 12 percent of the hospital ’ s patients . </s>  wyoming is among 14 states that do not participate in the affordable care act ’ s medicaid expansion , which provides coverage to low-income americans . </s>  “ my concern is that there is more of this in our future , ” mr. fitzgerald said of the layoffs . </s>  “ the global economy isn ’ t going to bounce back to full employment . </s>  the demand for what we produce here in northeastern wyoming will probably be depressed for a while. ” his hospital has received $ 10.1 million from the $ 72 billion in federal stimulus funds distributed so far to hospitals across the country , which he estimates will offset losses from the past two months but not the higher number of uninsured patients he expects to see in the future . </s>  the trump administration has earmarked $ 12 billion in relief funds for hospitals that treated 100 or more coronavirus cases , meant to offset the high costs of caring for patients whose hospital stays could last weeks . </s>  some of that funding will go to providence health systems , which owns 51 hospitals , including the seattle-area facility that treated the first confirmed coronavirus patient in the united states . </s>  the hospital system has treated 1,200 coronavirus patients , and executives do not yet know whether it will break even on that care . </s>  they estimate that , even after accounting for federal stimulus dollars , providence still lost $ 400 million in april . </s>  “ we have been in this situation much longer , because of seattle being on the forefront of the pandemic , ” said ali santore , the hospital system ’ s vice president for government affairs . </s>  “ we canceled elective

arrested in hong kong on monday morning under the national security law china promulgated on june 30 . </s>  in this op-ed in late may , published soon after the national people ’ s congress in beijing first announced its intention to pass the law , mr. lai had anticipated his arrest under it . </s>  hong kong — i am the chairman and majority owner of apple daily , one of hong kong ’ s largest newspapers , and since the city ’ s return to china in 1997 , i have feared that one day the chinese communist party would grow tired not only of hong kong ’ s free press but also of its free people . </s>  that day has come . </s>  on thursday , the party , acting through the national people ’ s congress in beijing , approved a plan to pass national security laws for hong kong that will mark the end of free expression and many of the individual liberties so cherished in the city . </s>  hong kong is moving from the rule of law to rule by law , with the chinese communist party determining all the new rules of this game . </s>  apologists for china , led by the hong kong chief executive , carrie lam , claim that the new legislation will only cover subversion , calls for secession , terrorism and other acts that truly threaten china ’ s national security . </s>  but the hong kong people are not fooled . </s>  since the ascent of xi jinping as china ’ s leader in late 2012 and early 2013 , hong kong booksellers have been kidnapped and forcibly taken to the mainland , democracy activists have been beaten up by pro-beijing thugs from the local triads and the city ’ s once-much-respected police force has turned on the people in the most brutal way . </s>  even sanctuaries of freedom from outside the city are now imperiled here . </s>  i joined twitter recently , and started posting messages about the new law last weekend , just after the chinese communist party first mentioned it : within a day , an article in the official communist party mouthpiece global times , citing experts , called my tweets “ evidence of subversion ” under the proposed national security law — this , even before the national people ’ s congress formally endorsed the legislation on thursday . </s>  i have always thought i might one day be sent to jail for my publications or for my calls for democracy in hong kong . </s>  but for a few tweets , and because they are said to threaten the national security of mighty china ? </s>  that ’ s a new one , even for me . </s>  hong kong is a free society . </s>  hong kongers say what we want to say — at least , as ms. lam put it on tuesday , “ for the time being . ” after the proposed national security law is enacted in hong kong — which could happen before the fall and the next local legislative elections — we will be able to say only what the chinese government tolerates . </s>  every sentence , every word will carry the risk of potential punishment on the mainland . </s>  when it comes to free speech , this law will remodel hong kong so that it becomes like the rest of china . </s>  it didn ’ t have to be this way . </s>  although hong kong has been troublesome for beijing since 1997 — there were protests in 2003 over another national security law and calls for true universal suffrage during the umbrella movement of 2014 — this was manageable trouble . </s>  but then last spring ms. lam , in a spectacular miscalculation , attempted to ram through the hong kong legislature an extradition bill that would have allowed the chinese communist party to drag hong kongers to the mainland to be tried for various crimes , including political crimes . </s>  that bill was an attempt by beijing to control hong kong on the sly . </s>  the people saw through the move and pushed back , with mass marches and months of protests . </s>  after they beat back the extradition bill and it was formally withdrawn , mr. xi and the chinese communist party dropped all pretense of noninterference in hong kong . </s>  for those of you who are not in hong kong , it ’ s important to realize that even many pro-beijing business tycoons let it be known that they opposed the 2019 extradition bill because it would have shattered the protections afforded by being in hong kong , including those that undergird the stability of the financial and business sectors . </s>  now , the new national security law goes much further , obviating the need for anything like the extradition bill . </s>  chinese security agencies and police bureaus are expected to be set up or operate in hong kong , to handle everything from supposed subversion and illegal democratic activities to the enforcement of patriotic education in schools . </s>  if the extradition bill was a rifle aimed at our rights , the national security legislation is a machine gun . </s>  mr. xi is no doubt taking advantage of this peculiar moment , while the free world , especially the united states , is engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  why let a good crisis go to waste ? </s>  virus or not , though , hong kong was always going to be tamed under the chinese communist party . </s>  as far back as july 2003 and that earlier attempt at passing national security legislation , under hong kong ’ s own basic law , the chinese communist party was already working at undoing the city ’ s unique freedoms . </s>  and back then , like today , even as china represses hong kong , it tries to convince the world that it is acting legitimately and openly ; it invokes process and procedures , laws and regulations . </s>  this is a charade , and it has long ago been dismissed by most hong kong people . </s>  yet the chinese communist party ’ s propaganda machine rolls on , offering a few talking points to beijing loyalists and a semblance of cover to compliant governments and an international business community that seem convinced , wrongly , they can keep making money in china without being sullied by its politics . </s>  hong kong is not alone in being threatened by a communist party seeking to expand china ’ s presence on the world stage . </s>  never has china been so aggressive on so many fronts : with taiwan , in the south china sea , at the indian border and worldwide , through its influence networks and united front operations . </s>  mr. xi ’ s repressive moves in hong kong are related to those other aggressions . </s>  and all of these are related to his need to justify to the chinese communist party why he should be ruler for life . </s>  mr. xi has a lot of justifying to do indeed . </s>  his “ one belt , one road ” initiative is sputtering , tainted by corruption and jeopardized by the growing risk that participating governments will default on loans they could never afford . </s>  most of the free world is rejecting his 5g ruse , as huawei , the chinese tech giant , is increasingly perceived to be a security threat by other countries . </s>  he has blundered by creating unprecedented tensions with america . </s>  his government ’ s delayed reaction to the spread of the coronavirus has translated into china ’ s worst economic performance since it opened up its market four decades ago . </s>  animosity festers against china all over the world for the lives , jobs and wealth destroyed by the pandemic . </s>  faced with these failures , mr. xi wants to be able to claim that , at least , he has taken full control of hong kong for the chinese communist party , after years of what many of the party ’ s senior members think was far too tolerant a treatment of our city . </s>  as that treatment hardens , though , the resolve of the people of hong kong to fight for our rights and our freedoms will only strengthen . </s>  and as we enter this new phase of our struggle , we need the support of the west , especially the united states . </s>  on wednesday , secretary of state mike pompeo announced that hong kong could no longer be considered to have significant autonomy from the mainland , a condition for maintaining the city ’ s special trade status with the united states . </s>  the white house is said to be weighing other reprisals . </s>  these measures stem from the right impulse , but some of their consequences must be carefully considered . </s>  i hope , for example , that the united states government does not completely lift hong kong ’ s privileged economic status . </s>  the city needs those special ties , so it can keep standing apart from the mainland and have at least some economic edge over it . </s>  removing those privileges would only make hong kong more dependent on china . </s>  [ update : after publication , president trump announced he would end hong kong ’ s special relationship with the united states . ] </s>  there are other ways to retaliate against china for its repression of hong kong : revoking student visas for the children of both chinese communist party and hong kong officials , and increasing scrutiny of party corruption abroad , for example . </s>  at the same time , granting rewards to hong kong people — including more immigration and visa privileges in the united states — would be an open rebuke to the chinese government . </s>  fighting for hong kong isn ’ t just about saving hong kong or sending china a message . </s>  the longer the west supports hong kong while we , hong kongers , fight for the rule of law , for individual rights , for our freedoms — for freedom , period — the more the world will realize how distrust-worthy china is , how dangerous it is to peace in the world . </s>  making this truth apparent is not about starting a new cold war with china . </s>  it is about bringing stability to the world so that the west can protect its own free way of life — and the rest of us can have a fighting chance at that , too . </s>  jimmy lai is the founder and majority owner of next digital , which publishes the apple daily newspaper and next magazine in hong kong and taiwan . </s>  @

campaigning for britain to leave the european union in 2016 — a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country — one of his close allies , michael gove , famously declared that “ people in this country have had enough of experts. ” now , mr. gove and mr. johnson are leading the british government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus , and mr. johnson , now the prime minister , insists the process is being guided by experts . </s>  the trouble is , those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action . </s>  that messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at imperial college in london . </s>  the report , which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in britain , triggered a sudden shift in the government ’ s comparatively relaxed response to the virus . </s>  american officials said the report , which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the united states from such a spread , also influenced the white house to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public . </s>  imperial college has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics , including sars , avian flu and swine flu . </s>  with ties to the world health organization and a team of 50 scientists , led by a prominent epidemiologist , neil ferguson , imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard , its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies . </s>  but outside experts pointed out that the report ’ s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak . </s>  “ a lot of it is not what they say , but who says it , ” said devi sridhar , director of the global health governance program at edinburgh university . </s>  “ neil ferguson has a huge amount of influence. ” imperial college , experts noted , was part of the advisory group for the government ’ s now-abandoned strategy , which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population . </s>  the theory is that this would build up so-called “ herd immunity , ” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter . </s>  but such a strategy , the report noted , would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds . </s>  instead , it said , britain needs to pursue “ suppression , ” which involves far stricter lockdowns , like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families . </s>  that would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period , allowing hospitals to cope . </s>  dr. ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from italy , which has seen a spiraling rate of infections , swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat . </s>  “ the u.k. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term , ” dr. ferguson said in an interview on monday , just after the report was released . </s>  “ based on our estimates and other teams ’ , there ’ s really no option but follow in china ’ s footsteps and suppress. ” the report added , “ this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days , with the refinement of estimates of likely icu demand due to covid-19 based on experience in italy and the uk. ” the coronavirus outbreak ›

lancet , the british medical journal , published an article in january , based on studying a small group of patients , which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units . </s>  “ i can ’ t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘ experts ’ to understand the scale of the danger from sars-cov-2 , ” said richard horton , the editor-in-chief of lancet , on twitter . </s>  “ those dangers were clear from the very beginning. ” some said governments should treat the report ’ s projections about suppression policies with the same caution . </s>  it says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more , at least intermittently , until a vaccine is developed and tested . </s>  but the report acknowledges this is uncertain , given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › let us help you better understand the

using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook , ” dr. sridhar said . </s>  “ but we ’ re in a different position than in 1918 . </s>  we ’ re in 2020. ” after days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “ herd immunity , ” the government sought to play down the dispute , arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it . </s>  but it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs , restaurants , theaters or museums . </s>  on tuesday , the government ’ s chief scientific adviser , sir patrick vallance , said he expected these new , more stringent restrictions to last for months — and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted . </s>  british officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth . </s>  all non-urgent operations in england will be postponed for at least three months , starting april 15 , to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus . </s>  britain lags behind other european nations in its supply of ventilators . </s>  plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000 , though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient . </s>  underscoring the change in tone , britain ’ s finance chief , rishi sunak , announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling british businesses and to try to stem job losses . </s>  the package , worth £330 billion , or $ 422 billion , will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners . </s>  “ we have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this , ” said mr. sunak , who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days , after britons were advised against all non-essential travel . </s>  mr. johnson hinted on tuesday that schools could be closed soon . </s>  but he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity , including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing . </s>  in fact , the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food .

does “ saturday night live ” look like without professionally crafted costumes , sets or hair and makeup ? </s>  without a studio audience or the ability of its cast members to be in the same place at the same time ? </s>  this weekend , for the first time in the show ’ s 45-year history , audiences got the chance to find out . </s>  beginning with this week ’ s opening sketch , which showed all 17 cast members joining in a video call from their home quarantines and ended with kate mckinnon exclaiming , “ live from zoom , it ’ s sometime between march and august ! , ” it was clear this would not be your customary episode . </s>  still , the show did all it could to keep things familiar , bringing in tom hanks as a guest host and chris martin as a musical performer and drawing upon its roster of famous alumni and celebrity pals . </s>  it was a little over a month ago — march 7 , to be exact — that “ s.n.l. ” broadcast its most recent live episode from its usual home at studio 8h in rockefeller center . </s>  daniel craig ( whose new james bond movie , “ no time to die , ” had been postponed four days earlier ) was the host ; the weeknd was the musical guest ; and senator elizabeth warren , who had just dropped out of the race for the democratic presidential nomination , made a surprise appearance in the show ’ s cold open . </s>  there were even a couple of sketches that joked about how the spread of coronavirus could have unexpected effects on our lives . </s>  we laughed at the time . </s>  but within days , the late-night talk shows announced that they were suspending their programs . </s>  “ s.n.l. ” — which has halted its season only a few times , usually because of writers ’ strikes — soon followed suit . </s>  even as the talk shows returned a short time after , in minimalist formats optimized for home-sheltering , it seemed hard to imagine how “ s.n.l. ” , with its sizable cast and substantial productions , could do the same . </s>  nonetheless , “ s.n.l. ” returned with a full complement of sketches that let us see directly into the homes of its performers . </s>  ( we ’ ll be thinking about the prominently placed acoustic guitar in colin jost ’ s apartment for a long time . ) </s>  sure , sometimes the audio was garbled or the lighting was off , and the whole thing had a distinctly youtube-circa-2009 aesthetic . </s>  but the familiar wing-and-a-prayer spirit of “ s.n.l. ” — let ’ s just put this out there and see what sticks — was there , too , and a lot of it stuck . </s>  opening monologue of the week hanks , who has been a frequent “ s.n.l ” host , dating back to the mid-80s , appeared in a segment recorded at his home , where he poked fun at his own status as one of the first celebrities to disclose that he had tested positive for coronavirus . </s>  ( he and his wife , rita wilson , were both in australia in march when learned they had the virus , and they were treated at a hospital there before being released a few days later . ) </s>  “ ever since being diagnosed , i have been more like america ’ s dad than ever before , ” hanks said . </s>  “ since no one wants to be around me very long and i make people uncomfortable. ” he said he had been treated well in australia , adding : “ they use celsius instead of fahrenheit when they take your temperature . </s>  so when i come in and they say , ‘ you ’ re 36 , ’ which seemed very bad to me , it turns out 36 is fine — 38 is bad . </s>  so basically it ’ s how hollywood treats female actors. ” before offering his gratitude to hospital staff , emergency medical workers and other helpers , hanks told viewers that this “ s.n.l. ” broadcast might be unusual . </s>  “ is it going to look a little different than what you ’ re used to ? ” he asked . </s>  “ yes . </s>  will it be weird to see sketches without big sets and costumes ? </s>  sure . </s>  but will it make you laugh ? </s>  eh . </s>  it ’ s ‘ s.n.l. ’ there ’ ll be some good stuff , maybe one or two stinkers . </s>  you know the drill. ” political impressions of the week the lack of costumes and prosthetics didn ’ t stop the performers from reprising some of their best-known impersonations of political figures . </s>  wearing a pair of granny glasses and a shirt that read “ super diva ! ” , kate mckinnon played the supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg as the host of her own home workout program . </s>  standing in front of hand-drawn posters that were taped to her walls , mckinnon exercised by lifting q-tips , punching tea bags and dropping some of the personal insults that she calls ginsburns : “ mitch mcconnell said that the administration didn ’ t focus on the virus because they were too distracted by impeachment , ” she said . </s>  “ i mean , are you in congress or parliament ? </s>  because your timeline is funkadelic. ” in a later segment , larry david appeared as senator bernie sanders , lamenting his recent withdrawal from the presidential race and making no apologies for not looking much like the real sanders right now . </s>  “ because of the stress of the campaign and the coronavirus , i ’ ve lost a lot of hair on top , which i don ’ t think is coming back any time soon , ” david said . </s>  he said he was sufficiently stocked up on toilet paper : “ please , i ’ m a 78-year-old man living in vermont , ” he said . </s>  “ i have a whole room full of toilet paper . </s>  and by the way , not the good stuff . </s>  single-ply . </s>  i ’ m talking prison t.p. ” the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates updated jan. 27 , 2021 ,

dwindle . </s>  biden plans to reopen obamacare exchanges in many states . </s>  and , in spite of everything , david-as-sanders said he was happy to be no longer pursuing the democratic nomination : “ i finally have the time to relax and finish that heart attack from october , ” he said . </s>  “ but my immediate plan is to do anything i can to beat donald trump . </s>  that ’ s why i ’ m voting for joe biden as enthusiastically as joe voted for the iraq war. ” sketches you might have seen on a traditional ‘ s.n.l. ’ broadcast of the week even though they didn ’ t have the full range of resources at their disposal , it was heartening to see the “ s.n.l. ” cast members attempt the kinds of sketches they would probably still have done , even if this had been a regular week at the studio . </s>  in one segment , a sendup of new technology that has suddenly become ubiquitous , mckinnon and aidy bryant played two slightly inept co-workers who simply could not figure out how to participate in a group zoom call . </s>  ( mckinnon switched her video screen to a still image of wayne brady while bryant accidentally brought her laptop into the bathroom . </s>  “ i thought this computer only did solitaire ! ” ) and what would “ s.n.l. ” be without a game-show parody ? </s>  this week ’ s installment , called “ how low will you go ? , ” was a “ love connection ” -style dating contest hosted by beck bennett and featuring bryant , heidi gardner and ego nwodim as single women newly released from quarantine who are eager to connect with just about anybody . </s>  though bennett tried to wave nwodim away from one desperate suitor played by mikey day , nwodim ignored the advice , replying , “ look , the last warm thing i touched was sourdough. ” the coronavirus

they would include the audio of a few ( unseen ) audience members laughing at their jokes . </s>  “ telling jokes with nobody just looks like hostage footage , ” che said . </s>  “ doing comedy with no audience , it kind of feels like when you ’ re in a long-distance relationship and your girl ’ s like , ‘ we can ’ t have sex but we can facetime. ’ and you ’ re like , ‘ ugh , i ’ d rather just cheat on you. ’ ” jost soon segued to election news : bernie sanders has dropped out of the race . </s>  which means that joe biden is now the presumptive nominee for 2020 . </s>  i just want to say on behalf of all comedians , thank you . </s>  i ’ m so excited because it ’ s either trump or biden , which means that we have comedy gold for the next four years . </s>  potentially with biden , the next eight years , and i just want to say , can you imagine the things biden ’ s going to be saying eight years from now ? </s>  che followed : this is bittersweet because i actually like bernie sanders , but him losing and making all those liberal white kids on twitter sad is the only thing getting me through this really rough week . </s>  boy , whenever i feel down , i just go online and listen to bernie supporters try really , really hard to not blame this loss on black people . </s>  i liked him but i knew he wasn ’ t getting the black vote because he kept bringing up health care . </s>  we don ’ t go to the doctor , man . </s>  the “ weekend update ” segment also featured a phoned-in appearance by alec baldwin in his recurring role as president trump . </s>  “ i ’ m happy to report , colin , that america is now no . </s>  1 in the world for coronavirus , ” he boasted , later adding : “ i ’ ve always said it was a giant hoax that we should take very seriously . </s>  even

said , “ in times like this , we need to come together as one nation . </s>  because no matter our differences , all americans can agree on one thing : carole baskin definitely fed her husband to those tigers. ” later in the segment , che paid tribute to his grandmother , who died earlier in the week of complications from the coronavirus . </s>  he told jost that their occasional joke-swap segments had been his grandmother ’ s favorite part of the show , and then asked jost to read a joke about a racial slur . </s>  after jost did as he was asked , che told him : “ my grandmother ’ s

a white-bread sandwich with one piece of deli meat and cheese , an apple , a squeezable yogurt package and a granola bar . </s>  kelly and other players wanted to make salads before leaving their team ’ s facility but were told they could not have anything else . </s>  the boxed meal was it . </s>  “ i went to a couple coaches , and essentially they said , ‘ we had it worse ’ and to deal with it , ” kelly said . </s>  actual lunch on the road at milb spring training . </s>  one slice of deli meat and cheese , an apple , a gogurt , and a nature valley bar . </s>  when we tried to make salads at

before the coronavirus outbreak threw their livelihoods into deep uncertainty this month , minor league players have endured wages ranging from roughly $ 1,000 to $ 15,000 per season ; poor nutrition and facilities ; sharing one small apartment with several teammates ; and often working side jobs to pay bills . </s>  unlike major leaguers , they have no union and fear speaking up against the m.l.b . </s>  teams that employ them , because that could jeopardize the chance of reaching the majors and a big payday . </s>  spending one day in the major leagues , on a prorated portion of a minimum annual salary that was $ 555,000 last season , would be worth more than a month in the minors . </s>  “ we ’ re trying to end this culture of silence , ” said garrett broshuis , 38 , a former minor league pitcher in the san francisco giants organization who became a lawyer in st. louis . </s>  broshuis — along with several other former minor league players , an active major leaguer , a labor activist and a marketing adviser — has formed a nonprofit called advocates for minor leaguers , which was unveiled on friday . </s>  the organizers hope to create a clearinghouse — through a website , social media accounts and their own efforts — for aggrieved minor leaguers to anonymously report their concerns , receive help and be represented with some group strength . </s>  “ without a collective voice , without representation at the bargaining table , they ’ ve just been left behind , ” said broshuis , who has been leading a class-action lawsuit against m.l.b . </s>  teams over minor league wages since 2014 . </s>  “ you can make a powerful statement , ” he added , “ if you say you represent the interests of 1,000 minor league player members , which one day we hope we can say. ” broshuis and his fellow organizers feel even more emboldened now , given the uncertainty thousands of minor leaguers face because of the cancellation of spring training and the indefinite postponement of the regular season . </s>  like their big league counterparts , minor leaguers do not receive paychecks until the regular season begins , which will not happen until mid-may at the earliest . </s>  but minor leaguers have much smaller security blankets — especially if they didn ’ t get large signing bonuses . </s>  many have returned home this week desperate to find part-time work , such as food delivery . </s>  as kelly put it , the pandemic has “ exposed their situation. ” “ it ’ s a time of struggle for a lot of people , and it ’ s a time of struggle and anxiety for a lot of minor league players as well , ” broshuis said . </s>  “ this just further demonstrates why there needs to be a group out there providing a voice and providing players with a platform to speak up , even if it ’ s anonymously. ” as concern about the pandemic shut down spring training last week , crowdfunding campaigns to support minor leaguers popped up . </s>  some m.l.b . </s>  teams continued paying minor league players their usual spring training allowance , $ 25 per day . </s>  some teams paid even more . </s>  then on thursday , m.l.b . </s>  announced that each minor leaguer would receive a payment equal to what he would have received for the canceled portion of spring training . </s>  according to news media reports , each player will get $ 400 a week for three weeks — more than the usual spring training allowance of $ 100 to 200 per week . </s>  m.l.b . </s>  said it would continue discussions about how to compensate players from april 9 , the original start date for the minor league season , to whenever the season actually begins . </s>  but the pandemic and emergency measures aside , the leaders of advocates for minor leaguers see many longstanding injustices to address . </s>  broshuis said the effort to form the nonprofit — which is registered in missouri and has federal tax-exempt status — was galvanized in the off-season when m.l.b . </s>  proposed severing the major league affiliations of 42 teams in lower levels of the farm leagues . </s>  he noted that 1,000 minor league player jobs were at stake . </s>  ultimately , broshuis would like baseball ’ s minor leaguers to have their own union , so they can collectively bargain with major league franchise owners . </s>  “ but in the interim , we ’ re not going to stand by and just hope and pray that a union forms , ” he said . </s>  “ we ’ re going to do what we can as a nonprofit advocacy group , and there ’ s a lot you can do. ” while broshuis acknowledged that the nonprofit would not be as powerful as a true union , he said that without collective representation minor leaguers were susceptible to exploitation such as wage suppression . </s>  he noted that while the inflation rate in the u.s. has been about 400 percent since 1975 , minor league wages have increased only 75 percent since then . </s>  before last season , the toronto blue jays issued 50 percent raises to their minor leaguers , and a few other teams , such as the chicago cubs and the giants , have followed suit . </s>  beginning in 2021 , m.l.b . </s>  is mandating a minor league wage increase of between 38 and 72 percent . </s>  but efforts to increase pay for minor leaguers were hindered by the “ save america ’ s pastime act , ” which congress put on page 1,967 of a 2018 spending bill to strip minor leaguers of protections under federal minimum wage laws . </s>  m.l.b. , which lobbied for the act , has likened minor leaguer players to seasonal apprentices , similar to musicians , artists and actors . </s>  broshuis has various goals for the new organization : a petition drive to establish a starting minimum salary of $ 15,000 for minor leaguers ; informing the public and lawmakers on the effects of m.l.b. ’ s longstanding antitrust exemption and the “ save america ’ s pastime act ” ; helping players in individual conflicts with their teams ; and gaining some control over the minor league drug policy , which m.l.b . </s>  can unilaterally change . </s>  broshuis ’ s fellow founders include kelly ; matt pare , a former giants minor league player who made a video series called “ the homeless minor leaguer ” ; raul jacobson , a former mets minor league player who is in law school ; and a veteran major leaguer who asked to remain anonymous to protect his employment opportunities , but who also said he planned to recruit other big league players to support the cause . </s>  kelly , 31 , who slept on an air mattress and received money from his parents for groceries during off-seasons in his minor league days , played parts of three major league seasons with the philadelphia phillies and the mets . </s>  he said he hoped to make videos with pare highlighting the struggles of minor leaguers . </s>  “ we just want to be able to provide that voice for guys , ” kelly said , “ and let them know that it ’ s ok to want to be able to live above the poverty line . ” </s>    key west , fla. — as governments around the world have grappled with how to rescue cruise ship passengers stuck on board luxury vessels hit with the coronavirus ,

reframe a perception of the wearer in their own mind. ” and at chanel , virginie viard continued her ever-so-gentle lightening up of the karl lagerfeld legacy . </s>  her main innovation thus far has been pockets ( that ’ s not sarcasm ; pockets are great ) but this time she also forewent the elaborate sets mr. lagerfeld made famous in favor of a mirrored floor and a few halfhearted smoke machines , across which her models ambled , sometimes in pairs , sometimes in threes , chatting away , as if they had forgotten they were on a runway . </s>  it was charming , in a voyeuristic way , but the stripped-down set also had the side effect of focusing attention on the clothes , which were — not . </s>  there was the usual bouclé , mostly in knee-length skirt suits and coats in citrine and watermelon . </s>  there were some little black dresses with the requisite white lace collar and cuffs . </s>  there was a nod to mr. lagerfeld ’ s love of a belle epoque frock : a strapless taffeta number with detached puffed sleeves . </s>  every look came paired with fairy-tale “ seven league boots , ” as ms. viard called them in her show notes , which were cool . </s>  but there were also hot pants over sheer logo tights and cropped white cotton dickeys . </s>  blouson gray bouclé high-waist sweats and a matching bandeau top . </s>  a ruffled wrestling pinafore over a white lace tee . </s>  and lots and lots of jodhpurs that looked more like very wide track pants with snaps — brass , diamanté — up the side , most of which had been popped open so the pant legs flapped awkwardly around the calves and knees . </s>  mr. lagerfeld often had similar clunkers in his shows , but they were obscured by the supermarkets and airplanes that surrounded them . </s>  ms. viard left hers front and center . </s>  that ’ s both brave and foolhardy . </s>  perhaps she was nostalgic for earlier days when the next gen ( because these could only have been directed at the youth vote ) could mosey

while there ’ s nothing wrong with a little yen for ye olden days — fashion was built on it — you can ’ t ignore the reality of right now . </s>  after all , the past is how we got to here : this

stranding people in jail . </s>  instead , the pandemic is an opportunity to rethink how the system treats low-level offenses , which account for more than 60 percent of arrests nationally . </s>  police officers often have the discretion to issue tickets and summonses for many misdemeanors , and that ’ s what they should do , rather than booking people on such charges . </s>  that would reduce the potential of spreading the virus in police stations and to the families and friends of officers . </s>  judges and prosecutors should suspend bail for defendants who are arraigned ( rather than ticketed ) for nonviolent crimes . </s>  jails and prisons , with crowded and sometimes dirty conditions , are known vessels of infection . </s>  the extra risk outweighs any benefit from setting bail for defendants accused of nonviolent crimes who can ’ t post it . </s>  judges can also delay court appearances for misdemeanor defendants . </s>  “ it ’ s nuts to force people to choose between their health and an added fine or bench warrant , ” as radley balko , an opinion writer for the washington post , pointed out this week , “ especially for alleged offenses that , by definition , aren ’ t comparatively serious. ” he added that he ’ s not advocating lawlessness : “ make rolling decisions as public health picture evolves , so public knows that any misdemeanors committed going _forward could still be punished. ” it also makes sense to stop arresting and incarcerating people for technical — that is , noncriminal — violations of parole and probation . </s>  about 4.5 million people live under court supervision around the country . </s>  in 2017 , they made up 25 percent of new admissions to state prisons , not because they committed new crimes , but for infractions like missed curfew or unauthorized travel . </s>  this practice often makes little sense in terms of public safety ; it is particularly hard to justify now . </s>  there are limits to what justice officials should do in response to the pandemic . </s>  they should not release people accused of violent acts who are likely to pose a threat , a group that can include those charged with misdemeanors relating to domestic violence . </s>  they should reduce the call for jury service but not violate a defendant ’ s right to a speedy trial with lengthy postponements for those who have already been waiting for long periods in jail . </s>  but right now , local and federal justice systems aren ’ t at risk of doing too much too soon . </s>  they ’ re at risk of doing too little , too late , and missing a

president trump were overwhelming . </s>  with the peak of the coronavirus pandemic still weeks away , he was told , hundreds of thousands of americans could face death if the country reopened too soon . </s>  but there was another set of numbers that also helped persuade mr. trump to shift gears on sunday and abandon his goal of restoring normal life by easter . </s>  political advisers described for him polling that showed that voters overwhelmingly preferred to keep containment measures in place over sending people back to work prematurely . </s>  those two realities — the dire threat to the country and the caution of the american public — proved decisive at a critical juncture in the response to the pandemic , his advisers said . </s>  the first of those two realities , the deadly arc of the virus , has been known for weeks even if disregarded by the president when he set his easter target . </s>  but the second of the two upended mr. trump ’ s assumptions about the politics of the situation and restrained , for a moment at least , his eagerness to get back to business as usual . </s>  the president ’ s reversal may prove to be an important pivot point in the effort to curb the pandemic , one that in the view of public health officials averted a greater catastrophe . </s>  mr. trump ’ s abrupt change of heart reflected a volatile president who has veered from one message to another , at points equating the virus to ordinary flu that will “ miraculously ” go away and at others declaring it an all-out war endangering the country . </s>  his move came as additional governors took action to stop the spread of the virus . </s>  with new orders on monday from the governors of arizona , maryland and virginia , as well as the mayor of the district of columbia , more than half of the 50 states and three out of four americans are or will soon be under the directive to remain at home . </s>  they took that action as the number of cases in new york

workers . </s>  gap said it would do the same for 80,000 store employees in the united states and canada . </s>  in the past two days , mr. trump has dispensed with the assertion that the cure could be worse than the disease and circled back closer to the tenor of the warnings he has gotten from health advisers . </s>  rather than lift the restrictions he had outlined by april 12 , he extended them to april 30 and said on monday that they “ may be even toughened up a little bit , ” although a national stay-at-home order like those in new york and california was “ pretty unlikely , i would think , at this time. ” at monday ’ s briefing , mr. trump recycled his line from a couple of weeks ago putting the virus ahead of the economy among his concerns . </s>  “ the economy is no . </s>  2 on my list , ” he said . </s>  “ first , i want to save a lot of lives. ” indeed , he again accentuated the starkest projections given to him by public health officials , noting that more than two million americans could have died in the absence of any measure , perhaps to set expectations so that any eventual death toll below that can be cast as a victory . </s>  but advisers said he was struck by the political surveying that indicated that the public wanted the restrictions to continue long enough to beat back the virus for fear that letting up too soon would simply reinvigorate the outbreak . </s>  “ there ’ s an acknowledgment that there ’ s no getting ‘ back to normal ’ if the virus is still a threat , ” said kristen soltis anderson , a republican pollster . </s>  “ and for the most part , we are seeing people supportive of leaders at the state and federal level , even if there is frustration about an initially slow response . </s>  however , if there ’ s a rush to reopen , the virus surges and people feel like the sacrifices they ’ ve made so far have been for naught , i can see that changing. ” in a survey conducted by john and jim mclaughlin , who were pollsters for mr. trump during the 2016 campaign , 52 percent of americans preferred a full national shutdown requiring everyone other than those deemed essential to stay at home as opposed to 38 percent who favored universal testing and isolating only those demonstrated to be infected with the virus . </s>  in a piece on newsmax , the conservative website run by a friend of the president ’ s , that appeared the day before mr. trump ’ s reversal , the mclaughlins wrote that the sentiment for a national shutdown prevailed in every region of the country and even among those who said they

shocked that his own associates had been affected . </s>  “ in one case , he ’ s unconscious in a coma and you say : how did that happen ? ” mr. trump said on monday . </s>  the larger picture fell to the public health advisers , who provided mr. trump with a grim prognosis in a meeting on sunday before his announcement extending social distancing guidelines . </s>  dr. anthony s. fauci , the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , and dr. deborah l. birx , the white house response coordinator , showed the president models of how many people across the

said on cnn on monday . </s>  that meeting appeared to resonate with mr. trump , officials said . </s>  senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina and a close adviser to the president ,

ingerman , sam barnes and ian prasad philbrick . </s>  our theme is composed by allison leyton-brown . </s>    as the coronavirus spreads across the globe , it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time : economic inequality . </s>  in societies where the virus hits , it is deepening the consequences of inequality , pushing many of the burdens onto the losers of today ’ s polarized economies and labor markets . </s>  research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease . </s>  they are also likelier to die from it . </s>  and , even for those who remain healthy , they are likelier to suffer loss of income or health care as a result of quarantines and other measures , potentially on a sweeping scale . </s>  at the same time , inequality itself may be acting as a multiplier on the coronavirus ’ s spread and deadliness . </s>  research on influenza has found that in an epidemic , poverty and inequality can exacerbate rates of transmission and mortality for everyone . </s>  this mutually reinforcing cycle , experts warn , may be raising the toll of the virus as it is widens the socioeconomic divides that are thought to be major drivers of right-wing populism , racial animosity and deaths of despair — those resulting from alcoholism , suicide or drug overdoses . </s>  “ these things are so interconnected , ” said nicole a. errett , a public health expert who co-directs a center on extreme event resilience at the university of washington . </s>  “ pre-existing social vulnerabilities only get worse following a disaster , and this is such a perfect example of that. ” because each low-income family forced to accept a higher risk of exposure can infect others , she added , the consequences of inequality , while most obviously felt by the poor , “ put the broader society at risk. ” how inequality worsens the coronavirus two major risk factors are thought to make the coronavirus deadlier for those who catch it : old age and pre-existing health conditions . </s>  but a body of research points to a third : low socioeconomic status . </s>  even for those well above the poverty line , studies find that low income relative to the rest of society is associated with higher rates of chronic health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease . </s>  this has not always been the case . </s>  as inequality has risen , health disparities have widened . </s>  preventive care and health education have steadily tilted toward the educated and the well-off . </s>  as a result , people at the lower ends of society are about 10 percent likelier to have a chronic health condition . </s>  such conditions can make the coronavirus up to 10 times as deadly , according to recent data from the chinese centers for disease control and prevention . </s>  taken together , these two statistics suggest that covid-19 can be about twice as deadly for those along their society ’ s lower rungs . </s>  at the same time , people with lower incomes tend to develop chronic health conditions between five and 15 years earlier in life , research finds . </s>  put another way : health organizations have said that people over 70 are at drastically greater risk of dying from the coronavirus . </s>  but the research on chronic health conditions suggests that the threshold may be as low as age 55 for people of lower socioeconomic status . </s>  those numbers capture only a sliver of the ways that inequality can make the coronavirus deadlier . </s>  in china , many workers are employed informally and so can not count on social services if they take time off — especially those in service jobs that require regular contact with other people . </s>  as a result , the people who can least afford care are often at greatest risk of transmission . </s>  in italy , some workers , like lorena tacco , who works at a factory near milan , have gone on strike over their employers ’ failure to establish what they consider sufficient health protections as the epidemic spreads . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates updated jan. 28 , 2021 , 4:05 p.m . </s>  et novavax ’ s vaccine works well , except on the variant first found in south africa . </s>  the pentagon says prisoners at guantánamo bay will be offered vaccination . </s>  a vaccination center in manhattan is changing its guidelines to prioritize neighborhood residents . </s>  “ who cares about the workers ’ health , while the rich run away , ” she said . </s>  “ but then poor people , who need to bring bread home , go out and take risks. ” domenico marra , who works at the same plant , said fear of the outbreak was rampant there . </s>  he worries about carrying an infection back to his children , particularly a daughter who has a weakened immune system . </s>  “ we do want to work , but we are scared of going home , we are scared to touch our family , ” he said . </s>  government-imposed shutdowns , like those announced by france and spain this weekend , do come with some worker protections . </s>  but small businesses will probably struggle to keep paying employees beyond any guaranteed sick days , particularly those in retail or other sectors that can not work from home . </s>  in japan , which has some of the lowest inequality of any major economy , people with jobs such as taxi driving enjoy a degree of security that rarely exists in other countries . </s>  in italy , in contrast , taxi drivers — already struggling on hourly wages undercut by the rise of ride-hailing services — scour for fares amid the outbreak . </s>  “ i have got a mortgage , bills and groceries to pay , ” said andrea arcangeli , a taxi driver and father of two from rome . </s>  “ i can ’ t stay home. ” he said he had made only 18 euros — about $ 20 — in a day ’ s work . </s>  at the nihonjo taxi company in osaka , japan , cabbies have a modest guaranteed monthly income , and the president , atsunori sakamoto , says he is selling off assets before letting drivers go . </s>  still , even in japan , these lower rungs of employment are hit harder than their white-collar counterparts . </s>  while office workers telecommute , with little fear of losing their jobs , mr. sakamoto says that if business does not pick up in a few months he may have to let drivers go . </s>  how the coronavirus worsens inequality when inequality is high , the cost of living tends to rise , forcing more lower-income families to live paycheck to paycheck . </s>  at the same time , the decline of labor unions and the rise of part-time work means that low-income workers have fewer protections . </s>  as a result , crises like coronavirus can deepen the gap between the haves and have-nots . </s>  lara fulciniti , a waitress in a suburb of milan , was barely covering her mortgage and car payments before the epidemic hit . </s>  as hourly work evaporates , she has fallen behind . </s>  “ i am not ashamed to say i did not pay my bills this month , ” she said . </s>  “ i had to choose between those and groceries. ” she fears , more even than catching the coronavirus , that her son ’ s school will reopen before she gets work , bringing gas and school lunch bills she can not afford . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › let us help you better understand the coronavirus are

million people globally . </s>  more than 2 million people have died . </s>  a timeline of the events that led to these numbers may help you understand how we got here . </s>  unequal access to health care in any country makes getting sick especially expensive for the poor . </s>  in the united states , 90 percent of people whose income is in the top quarter have paid sick leave at work , while only 47 percent of those in the bottom quarter do . </s>  last year , 26 percent of americans deferred health care because they could not afford it , one gallup poll found . </s>  in another survey , one in four said someone in their family had skipped a doctor-recommended test they could not afford , and one in six said that someone in their family had skipped prescribed medication . </s>  health experts fear that these costs will accelerate outbreaks , particularly as stories circulate of four-digit bills for coronavirus testing or treatment . </s>  this can affect everyone . </s>  one study in the united states found that state-mandated sick day policies reduce the spread of an influenza epidemic by up to 40 percent . </s>  most states have no such policy and could see far more infections as a result . </s>  labor inequality and poor workplace protections may exacerbate the spread of norovirus , a highly contagious stomach bug . </s>  research by the centers for disease control and prevention found that one in five food service employees went to work while sick with vomiting or diarrhea for fear of losing their jobs if they stayed home , turning restaurants into vectors for norovirus outbreaks . </s>  such conditions may have severely elongated the h1n1 epidemic in the united states , which killed 12,469 americans in 2009 and 2010 , according to a study by the institute for women ’ s policy research . </s>  though public health officials had urged social distancing — also a cornerstone of coronavirus prevention — spotty access to health care and the economics of part-time employment led three in 10 workers with h1n1 symptoms to continue going to work , the study found . </s>  the researchers concluded that this behavior drove a staggering 27 percent of all infections . </s>  the pandemic-inequality feedback loop when a health crisis hits entire segments of society , it can set off a cycle in which declining economic status leads to rising rates of chronic illness . </s>  that , in turn , further depresses productivity and raises health care costs , leading to more poverty , which leads to more disease . </s>  according to a 2010 study by a british biological sciences journal , proceedings of the royal society b , whole communities can become caught in a “ disease-driven poverty trap ” in which “ the combined causal effects of health on poverty and poverty on health implies a positive feedback system. ” families reliant on hourly work are already running out of money , forcing many back out to look for jobs . </s>  because communities tend to cluster by economic status , dr. errett said , the people who are both at the greatest risk of infection and likely to suffer most from the virus are all in proximity , multiplying the risk . </s>  longer-term consequences are coming into view . </s>  new york city officials have said that closing local schools would leave many of the system 's 114,000 homeless students without hot meals or medical care . </s>  even small pockets of mutually reinforcing poverty and ill health make everyone more susceptible . </s>  research conducted during an influenza outbreak in new haven , conn. , found that the rate of infection nearly doubled in census areas where a high proportion of residents live below the poverty line . </s>  because diseases do not respect the barriers that separate rich from poor , health inequality is a problem for everyone . </s>  a study from delhi , india , one of the world ’ s most economically polarized cities , found that its slums served as citywide accelerants for an influenza outbreak . </s>  “ public health isn ’ t just about your own personal health , it ’ s about the health of the public at large , ” dr. errett said . </s>  “ if there ’ s one person who can ’ t get treatment , that person is posing a risk to everyone. ” max fisher reported from new york , and emma bubola from milan . </s>  reporting was contributed by makiko inoue , hisako ueno , eimi yamamitsu and motoko rich from tokyo . </s>    the images are compelling : fire trucks in tehran or manila spray the streets . </s>  amazon tests a disinfectant fog inside a warehouse , hoping to calm workers ’ fears and get them back on the job . </s>  tv commercials show health care workers cleaning chairs where blood donors sat . </s>  families nervously wipe their mail and newly delivered groceries . </s>  these efforts may help people feel like they and their government are combating the coronavirus . </s>  but in these still-early days of learning how to tamp down the spread of the virus — whether it ’ s on steel poles in trains , the streets or the cardboard boxes delivered to homes — experts disagree on how best to banish the infectious germs . </s>  “ there is no scientific basis at all for all the spraying and big public works programs , ” said michael osterholm , director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota . </s>  “ it ’ s at best wasteful , and at worst we ’ re just putting disinfectants into the environment that we don ’ t need. ” most transmission of the virus comes from breathing in droplets that an infected person has just breathed out — not from touching surfaces where it may be lurking . </s>  “ transmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented , ” the centers for disease control and prevention notes on its website . </s>  hand washing remains important — now and always , dr. osterholm said . </s>  but to avoid getting sick , the public should focus on staying away from other people , he added . </s>  other experts are not ready to confidently dismiss disinfecting . </s>  there are just too many unknowns about this virus , said marc lipsitch , an infectious disease epidemiologist at the harvard t.h . </s>  chan school of public health . </s>  “ i ’ d personally be surprised if disinfecting outdoor spaces has any impact , but that ’ s more of a hunch based on first principles than a scientifically informed view , ” dr. lipsitch said , because no one has studied the issue yet . </s>  and it will be difficult to study the effectiveness of such moves , he said on a call with journalists on april 7 , because “ everyone is throwing a mix of interventions at the problem , as they should. ” to conduct scientific research , measures would have to be tried one at a time to gauge their effect . </s>  joshua santarpia , an associate professor of pathology and microbiology at the university of nebraska medical center , questions the widespread use of disinfectants outdoors . </s>  “ it seems like a little much , ” he said of the trucks spraying in other countries . </s>  “ it seems unnecessary to do that outside. ” claims made on facebook that helicopters would be spraying disinfectant in new york city were false , the associated press reported . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak ›

</s>  arizonans seeking vaccination are mistakenly calling an 8-year-old girl in missouri . </s>  dr. santarpia said that disinfecting surfaces indoors , though — in airports , for example — is a good idea . </s>  “ you want to make sure an indoor space is decontaminated before you allow people back in , ” he said . </s>  airlines , including delta , have been fogging aircraft with disinfectants . </s>  and transit authorities , including those in new york , boston and washington , d.c . , have stepped up their cleaning practices . </s>  the georgia national guard has been disinfecting the state ’ s nursing homes . </s>  the virus probably can ’ t survive more than a few days on most surfaces , according to one recent study , and it ’ s not clear whether the concentration of the virus on a surface would be enough to transmit disease . </s>  so theoretically , leaving a space alone for a week should be enough to decontaminate it . </s>  but dr. santarpia said most people understandably want the extra assurance that cleaning might provide . </s>  “ you want to be able to say , ‘ i cleaned it . </s>  i know it ’ s safe , ’ ” he said . </s>  the c.d.c . </s>  has issued guidelines on which products are effective at safely getting rid of the coronavirus , and the environmental protection agency has released a list of registered cleaning products that meet its criteria for killing it . </s>  household cleaners are designed to disinfect surfaces , not to eliminate virus from the air , said sandy posa , chief executive of force of nature , a start-up making an environmentally friendly disinfectant that meets the e.p.a. ’ s standard . </s>  dr. osterholm of the university of minnesota said he ’ s spent his 40-year medical career trying to convince people to be more diligent about washing their hands to prevent disease — so he doesn ’ t want to say it ’ s not important . </s>  but he believes that social distancing will prevent the majority of covid-19 infections . </s>    shailene woodley isn ’ t used to being at home . </s>  since she began acting at 5 years old , she ’ s spent much of her life on set in tv shows ( “ the o.c. ” and “ the secret life of the american teenager ” ) , movies ( the “ divergent ” franchise and “ the descendants ” ) and more recently , two seasons of the hbo hit “ big little lies , ” in which she played the troubled single mother jane . </s>  but now that the coronavirus has upended everything , the 28-year-old woodley has sheltered at home for the last few weeks , social distancing with no company besides her dog . </s>  it ’ s the longest she ’ s lived in her own home since she was 17 . </s>  and to be honest ? </s>  she ’ s kind of loving it . </s>  “ i ’ m an introvert ’ s introvert , ” woodley told me this week by phone , “ so this feels like heaven in a lot of ways because i don ’ t have to talk to people , i don ’ t have to deal with people , i don ’ t even have to look at people . </s>  i can play the game of being an extrovert when i need to — it ’ s a big part of my job — but my happy place is honestly being alone. ” normally , woodley would be gearing up for a press tour to promote her new film , “ endings , beginnings , ” but with theaters closed down , the movie will now debut april 17 on digital and on demand may 1 . </s>  in the romantic drama , directed by drake doremus ( “ like crazy ” ) , woodley plays daphne , a young woman torn between dating two best friends : jack ( jamie dornan ) , a nice guy offering stability and comfort , and frank ( sebastian stan ) , who ’ s wilder , harder to pin down and better in bed . </s>  much of the film is improvised , which posed a unique challenge for woodley and her co-stars . </s>  “ you understand the elements that create that particular person , and you create borders for that , ” she said , “ but the thing about a drake doremus movie is that you don ’ t really establish a character : you kind of go in as yourself. ” she also spoke about her new outlook on her career and health problems in her early 20s . </s>  here are edited excerpts from the conversation . </s>  when you don ’ t know what lines are about to come out of your mouth , how does that change your relationship to who you ’ re playing ? </s>  for me , when i ’ m building a character , i ’ m only experiencing different shades and colors of who i personally am . </s>  daphne is one color of me that i got to explore , but i was speaking as shailene , from a place within my own heart . </s>  i think she ’ s a little bit of my alter ego . </s>  how so ? </s>  when i was 18 , i moved into a cabin in the middle of the woods with no cellphone , no wi-fi . </s>  i ’ m a loner , and in daphne , i got to explore some of the more extroverted side of myself who could go out and be free and live with abandon . </s>  it was fun to put myself in the position to think , “ if i wasn ’ t worried about the consequences of taking all these drugs and staying at a bar in silver lake until 2 a.m. , what would that be like ? ” because it ’ s just not something i would allow myself to do . </s>  how do you approach a love scene differently when there ’ s a level of improvisation to it ? </s>  luckily , our intimate scenes came toward the end of the shoot , so there was a great level of trust with the actors . </s>  in one scene , sebastian picked me up and took me across the room as the camera followed us , and it was a completely different sex scene than what ended up in the movie . </s>  but we had to explore all different parts of these two people ’ s physical nature to really get down to the essence of what worked for this film thematically . </s>  was there an intimacy coordinator ? </s>  for me , intimacy coaches make me uncomfortable because it feels like another set of eyes that i don ’ t need . </s>  but i have no problem stopping production when i ’ m uncomfortable , and i don ’ t think that ’ s the case for a lot of people , so i think it ’ s wonderful that there ’ s a lifeline that people can lean on to know they ’ ll be protected . </s>  that being said , the best thing a director could do is ask an actor right off the bat : “ what are you comfortable with ? </s>  what are your boundaries ? ” there ’ s always a tension to cinematic love triangles where you wonder who the lead character will end up with , but while i was watching “ endings , beginnings , ” i did think to myself , “ what would be so wrong with daphne just continuing to see both men , if that ’ s something that they can make work ? ” listen , i ’ m someone who has experienced both an open relationship and a deeply monogamous relationship in my life , and i think we ’ re in a day and age where there should be no rules except for the ones designed by two people in a partnership — or three people , whatever floats your boat ! </s>  but there has to be a level of responsibility in any relationship dynamic , and that responsibility is simply honesty and communication and trust . </s>  apart from that , it ’ s really none of our business what people choose to do with their lives . </s>  and this situation is not necessarily about daphne trying to figure out which guy she likes more . </s>  it ’ s about them offering different versions of herself she could be , too . </s>  absolutely . </s>  we ’ re societally conditioned to assume that one person can be our end-all , be-all . </s>  this is a concept i ’ ve been thinking about often right now , because i ’ m very much single [ after being in a relationship for years with the rugby player ben volavola ] , and i ’ ve chosen to be single for a while . </s>  the idea of being with someone … is it only because you ’ ve fallen in love with that person , or because there ’ s a newness to understanding yourself because of what that person can offer you ? </s>  daphne spends much of the movie trying to unpack her past . </s>  you ’ re 28 now , nearing the end of your 20s . </s>  when you think back to what you were like 10 years ago , how different were you ? </s>  in my late teens , i had a strong idea of my identity and the meaning of my life , but then i went through an abusive relationship . </s>  that combined with , honestly , the commercial success i had in this industry began to wear on my strength . </s>  my 20s felt a little bit like being in a washing machine , where you ’ re being thrown all over the place . </s>  as a teenager and as a child , i always thought acting was a hobby , and i never wanted the idea of making it into a career to take away my passion for it . </s>  but in my 20s , there was a huge chunk of time where fear and anxiety and competition were definitely at the forefront of my mind and my ego in a way they weren ’ t when i was younger . </s>  was that being whipped up by the industry , or were those things deep inside you and you had to learn to deal with them ? </s>  i think it was probably a mixture of both . </s>  i haven ’ t spoken much about this yet publicly , and i will one day , but i was very , very sick in my early 20s . </s>  while i was doing the “ divergent ” movies and working hard , i also was struggling with a deeply personal , very scary physical situation . </s>  because of that , i said no to a lot of opportunities because i needed to get better , and those jobs ended up going to peers of mine who i love . </s>  they went on to a lot of success , but there was a mix of people saying , “ you shouldn ’ t have let that go ! ” or “ you shouldn ’ t have been sick ! ” that was combined with my own internal process of , “ am i going to survive what i ’ m going through right now and ever be healthy , or even have the opportunity to work on projects i ’ m passionate about again because of the situation i ’ m in ? ” i was in a place where i had no choice but to just surrender and let go of my career , and it brought out this negative voice in my mind that kept spinning for years and years afterward . </s>  and how are you feeling now ? </s>  now i ’ m on the other side of it , thank god . </s>  a lot of the last few years has been about focusing on mental health for me , and it ’ s a slow process . </s>  but because of that work , i feel very grounded and rooted in who i am and very clear about everything in my life , whether it ’ s my career or my relationships or my own internal worth . </s>  i feel very grateful to have walked that line of fire , because now i know what i don ’ t want to ever go back to . </s>    the coronavirus pandemic has led officials around the

kids , i would have said , won ’ t own devices or touch social media until age 13 . </s>  i probably would have launched into a tirade about how young brains can ’ t handle the complex rules of digital citizenship , after which you probably would have wanted to smack me with a smartphone . </s>  then the coronavirus happened . </s>  all of my clever plans flew out the window . </s>  now , my 8-year-old practically lives on our family tablet — doing a bit of online learning , sure , but also games , chat , facetime and email . </s>  our 5-year-old is not that far behind . </s>  and really , who can blame us ? </s>  my husband and i want our kids to feel socially connected even as we isolate ourselves in our home . </s>  we also have full work schedules and no school , no child care and no extracurriculars to keep our kids busy and keep us sane . </s>  screen time has become our life line . </s>  yet in all the chaos of this pandemic , i forgot why we had been so cautious about the digital universe in the first place — until bad things started happening . </s>  there were lunchtime zoom chats involving lewd conversations about body parts . </s>  rude emails sent and received . </s>  screen shots taken of chats without permission . </s>  and poop emojis — so many poop emojis . </s>  i wasn ’ t about to take the tablet away , but i realized i needed to set ground rules and have some important conversations . </s>  but how do you talk a young kid about online etiquette ? </s>  about sexting ? </s>  about , dear god , pornography ? </s>  i wasn ’ t sure , so i talked to some digital literacy experts . </s>  they were empathetic toward all the parents who have thrown their kids headfirst into the digital deep end over the past few weeks . </s>  “ let ’ s be easy on ourselves , because none of us — no one — is going to do things perfectly right now . </s>  it ’ s impossible , because we ’ re trying to juggle too much , ” said diana graber , the founder of cyberwise and the author of “ raising humans in a digital world . ” here ’ s the advice i was given . </s>  1 . </s>  communicate to your kids that digital devices deserve a special kind of respect . </s>  one way to do this is to set the rule that kids have to ask permission to go online or use a device , much as they would need to ask permission before walking over to a neighbor ’ s house . </s>  “ by just pausing at that permission-getting , you ’ re already asking a child to be conscious about what they ’ re doing , ” said liz kline , the vice president of education programs at common sense media , an independent nonprofit organization that provides technology recommendations for families and schools . </s>  2 . </s>  consider setting rules on when and where your kids have access to devices or specific apps . </s>  maybe they ’ re not allowed to use tablets in their rooms with the door closed , and instead have to use them in common areas . </s>  perhaps they can do certain activities ( like online reading ) in their rooms but others ( like chats and video chats ) must be done in shared spaces , where you can check on what they ’ re doing . </s>  if that sounds intrusive , consider that when your kids have real-life play dates , you ’ re likely to pop in every so often to check in and offer snacks ; digital play dates should be no different , said devorah heitner , ph.d. , the founder of raising digital natives and the author of “ screenwise . ” 3 . </s>  create a schedule so that kids are using their devices during periods when you can provide the most oversight . </s>  if you need screens to entertain your kids during the conference call you ’ re leading , that ’ s fine — but maybe that ’ s when you start a netflix show for them and take the remote control with you . </s>  in other words , set things up so that they ’ re least likely to get into trouble online while you ’ re distracted , said dr. heitner . </s>  4 . </s>  consider a technology agreement for each child . </s>  it may help you organize and remember these rules . </s>  here ’ s a sample agreement from common sense media , and here ’ s one from cyberwise ; once signed , they could go up on the refrigerator . </s>  if kids break the rules , come up with appropriate consequences — if they chatted when they weren ’ t allowed to , they might lose chat privileges for a while . </s>  if they did something egregious but didn ’ t really know any better , respond less punitively . </s>  maybe you explain to your child that the app they were using wasn ’ t really designed for kids their age , and that it doesn ’ t seem to be working well for their group of friends , so you ’ ll find another option . </s>  also , plant the seed now if you plan on rescinding some digital privileges after the coronavirus crisis has passed — perhaps you agree to download a particular app but note that this is just temporary , for use while everyone is stuck at home . </s>  5 . </s>  be sure to talk to your kids about privacy — or lack thereof — and tone . </s>  this is crucial . </s>  “ you really have to set expectations from the very , very beginning , ” kline said . </s>  one thing kids often don ’ t understand about the online world is that it isn ’ t private — that anything that happens online can live forever and be seen by anyone , including parents , teachers , principals and college admissions staff . </s>  ( even if your chat is private , for instance , screen shots can be shared . ) </s>  kline has what she calls her grandma rule : she tells kids that her grandma has very high expectations of her and everyone else , and that , when they ’ re online , they shouldn ’ t “ do anything that grandma ida wouldn ’ t have been okay with , ” she said . </s>  also , explain to kids that chats and emails are easy to misinterpret , so they should go out of their way to be courteous so that they don ’ t accidentally upset their friends or family . </s>  you might even want to get specific about what is and isn ’ t acceptable . </s>  a kid might think it ’ s funny to , say , send a good friend a photo of their private parts , but it ’ s important to explain that sending or even just receiving an illicit image of a child breaks federal and , often , state child pornography laws . </s>  teach kids , too , about the importance of keeping their information private . </s>  have them create usernames that don ’ t include their full names , and make sure they understand never to give out their home address or other personal details . </s>  6 . </s>  take some time to think about what you ’ re comfortable — and not comfortable — with your kids doing online . </s>  i , for instance , don ’ t want my kids to engage with strangers online , so i ’ ve been selective about the apps i let them use . </s>  i signed my son up for a kids ’ email that requires me to review and approve any emails that come from , or are sent to , people who aren ’ t on my kids ’ preapproved contact list . </s>  ( email programs that work this way include kids email , tocomail and zoobuh ; you can also create a gmail account for your child and manage it . ) </s>  i also don ’ t feel comfortable letting my kids watch youtube kids . </s>  although the site is supposedly kid-friendly , inappropriate content sometimes slips through , so i limit my kids ’ use to particular channels and stay close to them while they use it . </s>  “ it ’ s really easy to end up in a not good place on youtube quickly , ” kline said . </s>  for chats , i signed my son up for messenger kids , the kids ’ version of facebook messenger , because it gives me control over the people he ’ s allowed to chat with , and because , if i choose to , i can see the images and videos that he sends and receives . </s>  also , it has no ads or in-app purchases — although the app can transfer data to “ third party service providers ” that support the app as well as to other facebook companies . </s>  all these companies are required to adhere to data confidentiality obligations , but these obligations are only vaguely described in the latest privacy policy . </s>  other kid-friendly chat programs include blinx , cocoon and franktown rocks . </s>  if your kids play online games , make sure you ’ ve both read their rules and community standards . </s>  7 . </s>  it might be time to talk about pornography . </s>  “ conversations about pornography can and should start really early , ” said emily rothman , ph.d. , a community health scientist at the boston university school of public health . </s>  and by “ really early , ” she means kindergarten . </s>  you could explain to your kids that , just as adults drink coffee or alcohol but kids aren ’ t supposed to , adults sometimes like to look at pictures or videos of naked people , but that this kind of content isn ’ t good for kids ’ brains , and seeing it could be confusing or even scary . </s>  say , “ you should tell me if you ever see that stuff , not because i ’ d be mad at you or you ’ ve done anything wrong , but just because i want to know how to make your computer safer so that that doesn ’ t happen again , ” dr. rothman said . </s>  to minimize the chance that your child will accidentally stumble across pornography ( it ’ s easier than you think ! </s>  ) , activate parental controls on your devices ; here ’ s a guide to some ways to do so . </s>  there are also kid-friendly browsers that limit search results . </s>  8 . </s>  and remember : kids will be kids , including when they ’ re online . </s>  they ’ re going to engage with digital media in ways that don ’ t make sense to us . </s>  and as long as they ’ re being safe and courteous , that ’ s ok. “ it ’ s really important that when we share tools with kids , we expect them to do things that are unexpected , and that we expect them to do things that are developmentally where they are , ” dr. heitner said . </s>  their online interactions might seem especially bizarre right now because of the anxiety they ’ re feeling about the coronavirus . </s>  so we should allow them to be a little weird — to send emails containing only pig emojis or to facetime while doing headstands . </s>  and if you , like me , are somewhat shocked by all of the fart conversations you ’ ve been overhearing , remind yourself that your kids probably had these conversations with their friends before the coronavirus , too . </s>  you just weren ’ t privy to them because they happened at recess — rather than 10 feet away from you while you were trying to eat a sandwich . </s>  melinda wenner moyer is a mom of two and a science journalist who writes for slate , mother jones , scientific american and o , the oprah

pandemic before america ’ s foremost battleground state began another political brawl over the pandemic itself . </s>  officials from both parties rushed to familiar corners this week , with democrats rallying behind gov . </s>  tony evers ’ s decision to extend the state ’ s stay-home ordinance through may 26 , while republicans are stoking anger over what they depict as an assault on civil liberties . </s>  wisconsin ’ s decade-long partisan war will once again be on display friday , as right-wing protesters prepare to mass outside the state capitol in madison to assail mr. evers and the restrictions he put in place to curb the spread of the virus . </s>  thousands of people have indicated on facebook that they will attend , making it potentially the largest gathering so far in a nationwide series of protests against stay-at-home restrictions . </s>  republicans , in need of a show of force after badly losing a state supreme court contest this month , have sued mr. evers to block the extension , discussed removing his public health secretary and , in recent days , amplified protesters ’ calls to reopen the state while covertly helping to coordinate the madison rally and other satellite gatherings across the state . </s>  the planned protests on friday , along with smaller events last weekend , have focused attention on the thorny issues governors face as they grapple with the decision over when to ease restrictions , with president trump alternately encouraging protests calling for states to reopen and warning about the health risks of doing so . </s>  and in wisconsin , a state critical to both mr. trump and the presumptive democratic nominee , former vice president joseph r. biden jr. , the demonstrations serve as a stand-in for the general election battle to come . </s>  “ this seems to have become a proxy war for the state republican party and it does have a zombie tea party feel to it , ” said charlie sykes , a longtime conservative talk radio host in milwaukee who left the airwaves at the end of 2016 and has since turned against trump-era republicans . </s>  “ this will energize them to think that they ’ re back on the offensive . </s>  they didn ’ t miss a beat from losing that supreme court election and this all seems about mobilizing and firing up the base. ” the legal challenge to mr. evers ’ s extension follows a similar effort in early april , when republicans led by robin vos , the speaker of the wisconsin state assembly , successfully petitioned the state supreme court to block the governor ’ s order to move the election date as well as an effort to switch to an all-mail election . </s>  mr. vos , in an interview , portrayed the uprising against mr. evers as a broad response among wisconsinites that crossed party lines . </s>  “ it ’ s not just republicans , ” he said . </s>  “ it ’ s a whole lot of people who own a small businesses and they ’ re unemployed and there ’ s no reason they can ’ t work. ” vicki mckenna , a conservative talk radio host who has promoted the rallies on her program , said she hoped they inspired county sheriffs and local public health departments to defy the governor ’ s coronavirus orders . </s>  “ you go to central and northern wisconsin , you have folks who are looking at milwaukee and saying , ‘ we understand that they need help , but why do we have to sacrifice our entire livelihood for them ? ’ ” she said . </s>  while deep anger is growing on the right , there is some evidence that the republican stance on the coronavirus is repelling voters mr. trump will need to carry the state in november . </s>  future now fund , a progressive organization that focuses on state legislative races , found in a study that in this month ’ s state supreme court race , wisconsin counties with higher coronavirus infection rates saw larger shifts to the liberal candidate than did counties with lower rates . </s>  the shifts occurred in both urban and rural counties . </s>  “ experiencing coronavirus can push people beyond their tribal lane to a different engagement with politics , ” said daniel squadron , the co-founder and executive director of future now fund . </s>  and democrats ’ private polling in wisconsin conducted after the election but before the protests began found 72 percent of wisconsinites approved of how mr. evers has handled the coronavirus response . </s>  the same poll found mr. trump ’ s coronavirus job approval in the state was 51 percent . </s>  “ they can try to do this ‘ we ’ re going to play to our base ’ thing , ” said sachin chheda , a milwaukee democratic operative who ran the supreme court campaign for the victorious liberal candidate , jill karofsky . </s>  “ it ’ s bad politics . </s>  they might get some short-term wins , but it isn ’ t going to help them win in november. ” the organizers of the madison rally and the two others held last weekend have gone to great lengths to describe themselves and their events as nonpolitical , despite ample evidence that the state ’ s republican leadership is intricately involved . </s>  they are also trying to prevent the gatherings from becoming a platform for other conservative causes , or from appearing like de facto trump campaign rallies . </s>  brian westrate , the treasurer of the republican party of wisconsin , posted to a private facebook group for organizers and some attendees of the madison rally , asking people not to bring emblems of causes other than resisting the stay-at-home order . </s>  “ ok folks , i implore you , please leave confederate flags and/or ar15s , ak47s , or any other long guns at home , ” mr. westrate wrote . </s>  “ i well understand that the confederacy was more about states rights than slavery . </s>  but that does not change the truth of how we should try to control the optics during the event. ” in an interview , mr. westrate acknowledged writing the post and said it may be futile to ask the rally participants to limit the variety of their political motivations . </s>  “ ideally , people should leave trump stuff at home , ” he said . </s>  “ but you can ’ t hold a rally in favor of the first amendment and then become over-draconian in terms of telling people how to dress. ” at two rallies last weekend , in the conservative milwaukee suburb of brookfield and the rural town of mosinee , protesters carried confederate flags , waved trump signs and toted firearms , according to attendees and news photographs of the gatherings . </s>  cory tomczyk , who hosted the mosinee rally on the grounds of his industrial recycling company — which provides raw materials to companies making paper products — said he hoped the protests served as a conservative resistance in the same way that the state ’ s liberals were galvanized by gov . </s>  scott walker ’ s 2011 move to end collective bargaining rights for the state ’ s public employees . </s>  “ people have this image in their head that they ’ re going to make it look like the protest for act 10 , ” mr. tomczyk said , referring to the uprising against mr. walker ’ s labor law . </s>  “ i don ’ t know if it will look like that , but i hope it will. ” with ms. mckenna and others in the state ’ s powerful network of conservative talk radio hosts promoting the rally daily , the event will likely draw scores of republican elected officials on hand to lend their support , but perhaps not dominating the stage . </s>  shae sortwell , a republican state representative from manitowoc county , said his caucus ’ s g.o.p . </s>  leadership suggested members not speak at the rally to try to make sure it comes across as “ a citizen-led effort. ” mr. sortwell said he had no qualms about attending the rally . </s>  “ do we want to take away what people have to live for in the sole pursuit of one singular goal of additional survival , ” mr. sortwell said . </s>  “ is it safe , is it unsafe ? </s>  i don ’ t know. ” adrianne melby , a social media marketer for a racine county chiropractic firm who is one of the planners of the madison rally , said organizers had sought to portray the event as homegrown and apolitical . </s>  she said they turned down a donor ’ s offer to help pay for the event , though ms. melby declined to say who made the offer . </s>  wisconsin ’ s state capitol police on monday denied the madison group ’ s official permit request . </s>  mr. evers ’ s spokeswoman , melissa baldauff , said there would not be an effort to stop people from gathering outside the capitol — they just would not be allowed inside the building . </s>  mayor satya rhodes-conway of madison said she would not use the city ’ s police department to force protesters to disperse . </s>  “ all indications are that these are manufactured protests , ” ms. rhodes-conway said . </s>  “ they are seeking attention . </s>  i think they are getting more attention than they deserve. ” one prominent dissenter among the state ’ s republicans is senator ron johnson , who rose from being the chief executive of a plastic manufacturer to winning a senate seat in the 2010 tea party wave . </s>  mr. johnson said he wouldn ’ t criticize the governor ’ s stewardship of the pandemic response , adding that concerns about the economic impact should not lead wisconsinites to disavow public health guidance . </s>  “ i ’ m not going to gather in crowds , ” said mr. johnson , who said he is donning a mask when he goes grocery shopping near his home in oshkosh . </s>  “ i have enough fear and respect of this illness that i ’ m not going to do that myself . </s>  i ’ m not encouraging anybody to do it. ” still , few people wore masks or other protective equipment at the weekend rallies . </s>  and mr. vos , who wore body-length personal protective equipment during his shift as a poll monitor in his hometown , burlington , on april 7 , declined to say in an interview whether it is safe for thousands of people to gather in protest at the state capitol . </s>  “ i ’ m not a doctor , ” mr. vos said . </s>  “ i don ’ t give advice to people on how surgery should be done . </s>  i think people should make their own choices. ” lisa lerer and lauren justice contributed reporting </s>    paris — with the spread of the coronavirus accelerating at an alarming rate in france , president emmanuel macron addressed the nation monday evening with a call for mobilization . </s>  before millions of television viewers , he looked directly into the camera and declared , “ we are at war. ” in 20 minutes , he said it six times . </s>  mr. macron announced new restrictions on daily life that will keep the french confined to their homes , except for brief forays to shop for food or to go to indispensable jobs . </s>  it was his second attempt in five days to rally the unruly french and convince them that the only way to fight the virus was to accept social distancing . </s>  it has not been easy . </s>  after the terrorist attacks in paris on nov. 13 , 2015 , that killed 130 people , many of them gunned down at cafe terraces , parisians took pride in going out again , in a defiant collective gesture . </s>  the hashtag # jesuisenterrasse flourished on social networks , echoing the earlier slogan “ je suis charlie ” that had followed the attack on charlie hebdo ’ s journalists some months earlier . </s>  last week , faced with an even deadlier enemy , the invisible virus , parisians were instructed to do exactly the opposite by a new hashtag : # restezchezvous ( stay home ) . </s>  in a previous tv address on thursday , march 12 , mr. macron announced that nurseries , schools and colleges were being shut down . </s>  this did not prevent the french from flocking , during last weekend , to bars and restaurants as though joie de vivre could beat the coronavirus . </s>  then , with mr. macron ’ s tv speech on monday , came new restrictions , closing all public places and businesses other than food stores , pharmacies , newsstands and banks . </s>  should he have also canceled the local elections , held the day before ? </s>  president macron ’ s instinct had been to postpone the vote , but according to his entourage , fear of breaking up a budding national unity made him give in to the pressure of center-right party leaders , optimistic about their own electoral gains . </s>  that was a fateful mistake . </s>  while the voting turnout was low , the number of picnickers in parks and along the seine river on that sunny sunday was shockingly high , infuriating medical experts , who were painfully aware of the danger as hospitals filled up . </s>  hence the warrior rhetoric , with a call for social responsibility . </s>  “ we fight neither against an army nor against another nation , but the enemy is there , invisible , elusive and advancing , ” president macron said , invoking the language of georges clemenceau , the prime minister who led france during world war i . </s>  this

united ? </s>  recent polls showing that a majority trust the government to handle the coronavirus crisis properly may sound like a miracle for an unpopular young president of a deeply fractured country , shaken by strikes and yellow vests . </s>  but it is a thin majority , and the war has yet to be won . </s>  this crisis is a study in contrasts as the countries of the european union take different lines of approach . </s>  in germany , chancellor angela merkel also addressed her fellow citizens on monday evening . </s>  instead of declaring war , she listed every commercial and social activity about to be suspended , including “ brothels , places of prostitution and similar facilities. ” “ i do prefer chancellor merkel ’ s language , ” reinhard bütikofer , a european parliament member for the german greens , wrote on twitter after mr. macron spoke . </s>  “ she talks to us as citizens , not as soldiers . </s>  fighting a virus is not a war. ” françois godement , a french scholar on china , begged to differ . </s>  “ please bear in mind war has less of a bad name here , ” he tweeted back , explaining that what president macron meant “ is mobilization and social discipline — something we are not good at. ” two days later , ms. merkel was back on tv , this time more solemn , to implore the germans to take the situation seriously . </s>  it is a war on two fronts — the health crisis , with its tragic human cost , and the looming economic catastrophe . </s>  europe , not france , is the battleground , though each country is retreating behind its borders , awkwardly convinced that national responses will prove more effective against a disease that knows no borders . </s>  not only must we brace ourselves for the prospect of “ many more families losing loved ones , ” as britain ’ s prime minister , boris johnson , has warned , but in a matter of days , our world and our way of life have dramatically shifted . </s>  globalization has given way to

revealed that some goods and services must be put outside the rules of the market . </s>  to delegate to others our food , our protection , our ability to take care of our way of life is folly. ” on

crossed the u.s. border nearly eight months ago and was detained as a minor by the u.s. office of refugee resettlement , long before the novel coronavirus existed . </s>  as his 18th birthday approached last month , it appeared he would be released to a texas shelter where the director promised that the teenager would be “ provided counseling and referred for any medical assistance he may require ” for high blood pressure , severe anxiety and , if necessary , covid-19 , should the virus reach the shelter . </s>  instead , on the day he became an adult in the eyes of the u.s. government , agents from immigration and customs enforcement swooped in and shipped him to the otero county processing center in el paso , where he says he sleeps arm ’ s distance away from dozens of other immigrants . </s>  “ i have no doctor . </s>  i have medication but it is one given to me in the previous shelter , when i was a minor , ” said isaac , who asked to be identified only by his middle name for fear of retaliation . </s>  around 32,000 migrants remain in custody on civil charges as ice faces growing pressure to address the health concerns posed by the spreading coronavirus , including scores like isaac who were initially taken into custody as minors , then held long enough to age into the adult detention center . </s>  as of wednesday night , ice had confirmed 287 cases of the virus among detainees and 35 cases among staff members . </s>  earlier this year , lawyers representing two migrants argued in a class-action suit that the department of homeland security and ice had violated a statute that mandates how migrant children should be protected by relying on dubious technology and the discretion of individual local field offices . </s>  as a result , instead of minors going to a group home , they are ending up in ice jails . </s>  the administration ’ s system of deciding where to place such “ age outs ” exemplifies the extent of president trump ’ s hard-line immigration policies . </s>  those moves include an executive order signed on wednesday that restricts legal immigration into the united states and obscure procedural maneuvers like age-out detentions that not only limit opportunities to claim refuge in the country but also could expose a vulnerable population to the pandemic . </s>  the education department this week even prohibited higher education institutions from offering emergency assistance to undocumented students who were brought to the united states as children and are currently protected from deportation . </s>  the coronavirus has re-energized the president ’ s immigration efforts , even as it brings new scrutiny . </s>  a federal judge in california this week ordered ice to review the cases of detainees at high risk of catching the virus , including those over the age of 55 . </s>  but the coronavirus has also amplified concerns over the already contentious — and possibly illegal — practice of moving young migrants like isaac on their 18th birthday from relatively benign shelters managed by the department of health and human services ’ office of refugee resettlement into the department of homeland security ’ s ice detention centers . </s>  while the safest option for the teenagers would be to be released to a sponsor , immigration lawyers say the shelters and group homes would provide more space and care than the detention facilities , where they say the young migrants would be mixed with another contingent population and be exposed to the virus , as well as psychological harm . </s>  “ our clients are terrified of the prospect of being transferred to a secured detention facility with large numbers of people in close , confined settings , which is in direct contravention with c.d.c. ’ s advice on how to save oneself from this pandemic , ” said anthony enriquez , the director of the unaccompanied minors program at catholic charities , who is representing another teenager in new york who in recent weeks was handcuffed by ice agents on his 18th birthday and moved to a detention center . </s>  “ this is a real recipe for a humanitarian disaster , ” mr. enriquez said . </s>  beyond the health risks are legal questions : a federal judge in the district of columbia will soon rule on whether the trump administration ’ s age-out effort violates the law . </s>  by choosing to detain teenagers instead of releasing them to group homes or sponsors , lawyers argue , the administration has violated the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act , which requires the government to consider “ the least restrictive setting available ” to the migrants . </s>  in houston , ice agents placed 97 percent of teenagers transferred from the resettlement office ’ s custody into detention centers as opposed to group homes , according to an analysis of government data from october 2018 to may 2019 submitted during trial . </s>  in miami it was 96 percent and in el paso 80 percent . </s>  lawyers for young detainees said the government had proved it did not have to happen that way . </s>  an ice agent from the san antonio field office , where placement statistics are considerably better , testified during the trial that if the resettlement office had not matched a teenager with a sponsor , he would find a group home that would take the migrant in . </s>  ice agents in san antonio placed just 2.6 percent of young migrants into detention facilities as opposed to releasing them to group homes or sponsors between october 2018 and may 2019 . </s>  “ we don ’ t detain our age-outs , ” the ice officer , jose munguia , testified . </s>  april grant , a spokeswoman for ice , declined to comment on the details of the continuing litigation . </s>  ms. grant said that when deciding whether to detain migrants who were aging out , the agency considered whether they were flight risks or dangers to themselves or the community , as well as whether an alternative space was available . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates updated jan. 29 , 2021 , 9:34 p.m . </s>  et ‘ it ’ s numbing ’ : nine retired nuns in michigan died of covid-19 . </s>  france

administration is using a rigged system that ensures immigrants in certain parts of the country will be detained when they turn 18 , according to stephen patton , one of the lead lawyers in the trial litigated by the national immigrant justice center and kirkland & ellis in the district of columbia . </s>  ice ’ s computerized “ risk classification assessment ” system allows agents to enter a migrant ’ s information , then recommends detention or release . </s>  but according to court documents , the agency tweaked the tool in august 2017 to eliminate the option of release , leaving only the recommendations of “ detain ” or “ supervisor to determine. ” a worksheet requiring ice agents to document their considerations for alternatives to detention did not include a space to detail the potential shelters available . </s>  agents are left with two options : “ detain ” or “ not detain. ” “ there was not a shred of evidence that releasing these kids caused any problems or finding sponsors for them was an undue burden , ” mr. patton said . </s>  “ they could comply if they wanted to , and if they do comply almost everyone gets released. ” another issue with resettling minors has been the trump administration ’ s efforts to require sponsors to provide fingerprints to the government . </s>  that has discouraged immigrant relatives from coming _forward to claim minors in custody , immigration advocates say . </s>  in the 2019 fiscal year , 2,055 migrants were transferred to ice custody , nearly double the 1,091 in the 2017 fiscal year , according to the health and human services department . </s>  mark weber , a department spokesman , said more than 140 young migrants had been handed over to ice in 2020 , but that is a small percentage of the children who cross the border each year and most are eventually matched with sponsors . </s>  mr. weber said the department grappled with the most border crossings in more than a decade last year and was still able to place 72,593 children with sponsors . </s>  he said “ a special effort ” was made to release the children before they turn 18 . </s>  ms. grant , the ice spokeswoman , declined to say how many of the

, told the house oversight committee last week that such a move would be a “ huge pull factor ” and create a “ rush at the borders , ” according to a statement from the committee . </s>  the agency said in a statement that it was continuing to consider releasing immigrants to “ alternatives to detention options. ” those who have aged into the ice detention centers say the virus has only added to concerns that include threats from fellow detainees , poor treatment by the staff and a lack of medical resources . </s>  sulma hernandez alfaro , who fled to the border to escape abusive relatives in honduras , said she was confused when ice agents showed up at the government shelter where she was staying in san benito , texas , in 2017 . </s>  she had already been told by the staff that she would be released to a nearby group home , la posada providencia , when she turned 18 . </s>  her lawyers ’ pleas to ice to release her to the group home went unanswered , according to court filings . </s>  she said she was threatened by other detainees and treated poorly by the detention center ’ s staff . </s>  on one occasion , a guard yelled at her when she asked for a tampon . </s>  when she asked for a spare change of clothes , she was scolded . </s>  “ she just yelled at me and said i should just wash it in the sink because that ’ s why i have hands , ” ms. alfaro said . </s>  a court ordered ms. alfaro ’ s release in may 2018 , six days before she was granted asylum . </s>  those are the same protections jose hernandez velasquez hoped to obtain when he crossed the border in 2017 . </s>  mr. velasquez was erroneously moved from the custody of the office of refugee resettlement as a 17-year-old after he was given a dental exam that mistakenly determined he was an adult , according to his lawyers , who later obtained a birth certificate proving he was a minor . </s>  by then he had already spent 10 months in a maximum-security detention center . </s>  such dental assessments are

america ’ s dismal response to the coronavirus on “ smug complacency , this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build. ” he proposed a solution that fit squarely into silicon

musk ’ s “ alien dreadnoughts. ” “ building is how we reboot the american dream , ” mr. andreessen wrote in his post , which he titled “ time to build. ” it was an inspirational call to arms . </s>  but one of the first things mr. andreessen and other silicon valley venture capitalists have since rushed to help build was something else entirely : an app called clubhouse . </s>  clubhouse is a social media app where venture capitalists have gathered to mingle with one another while they are quarantined in their homes . </s>  the app is , for now , invite-only , and buzzy : seemingly everyone who has been allowed to join the early test version , from celebrities like mc hammer to activists like deray mckesson , has tweeted about it . </s>  and it has recently been one of the

andreessen horowitz agreed to put in $ 10 million , plus pay $ 2 million to buy shares from clubhouse ’ s existing shareholders , said a person with knowledge of the funding , who declined to be named because the details were confidential . </s>  the financing valued clubhouse , which started this year and has two employees , at nearly $ 100 million . </s>  the deal was reported earlier by forbes . </s>  andrew chen , a partner at andreessen horowitz , said on twitter that he interpreted mr. andreessen ’ s “ time to build ” as building more of everything , including “ new gaming cos , social apps , fitness and more ! ” the rush to invest in clubhouse reflects the way silicon valley works . </s>  while cutting-edge technology and a change-the-world mission are paramount , much of the big money in recent decades has ultimately been made from addictive social media apps . </s>  so when it comes to building new things , silicon valley often turns to what it knows — and that is more social networks . </s>  jeremy liew , an investor at lightspeed venture partners , said his firm , along with “ most of silicon valley , ” had spoken to the founders of clubhouse in recent weeks . </s>  the app “ got some early traction with v.c.s and entrepreneurs , and no doubt that is why some firms leaned in , ” he said , adding that lightspeed did not pursue an investment . </s>  “ they generalized from their own positive experiences. ” andreessen horowitz declined to comment on mr. andreessen ’ s essay and any connection to the clubhouse investment . </s>  mr. andreessen , mr. chen and their partner , ben horowitz , have been frequent faces in the app . </s>  last week , mr. horowitz answered questions from clubhouse ’ s users about his barbecue techniques and favorite dining spots , adding how impressed he was with what the app ’ s founders had built . </s>  paul davison , who founded clubhouse with rohan seth , a former google engineer , declined to comment . </s>  mr.

who have it are already addicted . </s>  one woman recently discussed spending more than 40 hours a week on it ; others have tweeted similar statistics . </s>  clubhouse works by letting people join pop-up audio chat rooms that disappear when they end . </s>  once in the rooms , users are segmented into tiers determined by moderators . </s>  users can join any chat room , see who is speaking or listening , click into a profile page and follow others . </s>  some said clubhouse had brought back the spontaneity of real-life interactions , which vanished with the coronavirus . </s>  gillian morris , founder of hitlist , a flight booking app , said logging in to the app felt like bumping into people and striking up a conversation at a coffee shop . </s>  “ it ’ s like walking into a party where you know people are ready to mingle , ” said sonia baschez , 33 , a digital marketing consultant in san francisco who was invited to use clubhouse . </s>  since joining the app a week and a half

at around 10 nearly every night , 30 to 50 people form a room on the app where everyone is a host , moderator privileges are given freely , microphones are mostly unmuted and users swap their profile pictures in real time to memes and images related to the conversation . </s>  they call themselves the “ back of the bus. ” ryan dawidjan , 28 , an account executive at a tech company , holds court and ensures everyone in the room follows the rules : no boring tech talk and no talking about clubhouse . </s>  he playfully boots people from host roles for violating these sacred terms . </s>  the format of “ back of the bus ” is fluid . </s>  sometimes there is a tarot card reader critiquing a member ’ s instagram account ; sometimes it is a dating advice show ; sometimes bored people sound off about anything that pops into their mind . </s>  clubhouse has already minted its first influencer : sheel mohnot , 38 , founder of better tomorrow ventures , another venture firm . </s>  mr. mohnot , a staple in “ back of the bus , ” has been a contestant on the zoom bachelorette , a pop-up online dating event for which fans hosted a live discussion party on clubhouse . </s>  after connecting through the app with scooter braun , an entrepreneur and record executive , mr. mohnot was featured in a recent justin bieber and ariana grande music video . </s>  clubhouse is “ like a

platform , who is on the app , said , “ you don ’ t want to leave clubhouse because you feel like when you leave , something crazy is going to happen. ” all of that has whetted the appetite of venture capitalists . </s>  apart from the andreessen horowitz investors , others from top silicon valley firms like benchmark and greylock partners are also in the app . </s>  many have offered product feedback in clubhouse and declared that it was the future of audio . </s>  some have wrangled celebrity connections to try it . </s>  yet even before clubhouse launches , it has encountered issues that larger social media companies struggle with . </s>  on sunday , the entrepreneur sriram krishnan changed his name on the app to tim cook , apple ’ s chief executive , as a prank . </s>  more than 100 people immediately joined the room . </s>  hours later , someone impersonated mr. musk , the tesla chief . </s>  that led mc hammer , a clubhouse user , to publicly call on the company to

had tested positive for the illness . </s>  but how worried should you really be ? </s>  here ’ s what public health experts and others are saying . </s>  ‘ a cause for caution — not for alarm ’ the

</s>  “ this is where you get new and emerging diseases that the human population has never seen before , ” said kevin j. olival , a biologist and vice president of research with ecohealth alliance , a nonprofit research organization . </s>  in response to the contagion , china — still carrying the memory of sars , the century ’ s first coronavirus to make the leap to humans , which killed nearly 800 people — has temporarily banned the sale of wild animals and effectively placed more than 35 million people on lockdown , blocking expressways and canceling all flights and trains out of the region . </s>  [ related : are the quarantines ethical and effective ? ] </s>  it ’ s the largest quarantine in history , but it ’ s unlikely to contain the virus , writes howard markel , a professor of the history of medicine at the university of michigan . </s>  the quarantine has taxed wuhan ’ s ability to care for its sick while doing little to prevent the virus ’ s spread , dr. markel notes . </s>  amid the lunar new year holiday , china ’ s busiest travel season , some five million people had already left the city before it was sealed . </s>  “ the more we learn about it , the greater the possibility is that transmission will not be able to be controlled with public health measures , ” dr. allison mcgeer , a toronto-based infectious disease specialist , told helen branswell at stat

elderly parents at home . </s>  what if we all get sick ? ” but many experts say people in the united states shouldn ’ t panic . </s>  the virus is thought to be less lethal than both sars and mers , the last zoonotic coronavirus to infect humans , in 2012 . </s>  and the vast majority of confirmed cases remain in mainland china , as catherine kim reported at vox . </s>  “ make no mistake , this is an emergency in china . </s>  but it has not yet become a global health emergency , ” said tedros adhanom ghebreyesus , the director general of the world health organization . </s>  although the outbreak is a “ very serious public-health threat , the immediate risk to the u.s. public is low at this time , ” nancy messonnier , director of the centers for disease control and prevention ’ s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases , said friday . </s>  for perspective : the flu kills roughly 35,000 americans every year . </s>  this season , it has already sickened an estimated 15 million americans and killed 8,200 , according to c.d.c . </s>  estimates . </s>  influenza kills more americans every year than any other virus , dr. peter hotez , a professor at baylor college of medicine , told liz sabo at kaiser health news . </s>  but the flu is rarely paid such attention , and fewer than half of adults get a vaccine . </s>  “ when we think about the relative danger of this new coronavirus and influenza , there ’ s just no comparison , ” dr. william schaffner , a professor at vanderbilt university medical center , told ms. sabo . </s>  “ coronavirus will be a blip on the horizon in comparison. ” “ if americans aren ’ t afraid of the flu , perhaps that ’ s because they are inured to yearly warnings , ” ms. sabo writes . </s>  “ for them , the flu is old news . </s>  yet viruses named after foreign places — such as ebola , zika and wuhan — inspire terror. ” the beaverton , a satirical publication , summed up matters thusly : ‘ we don ’ t know how bad it will get ’ there ’ s still a good deal we don ’ t know about the coronavirus . </s>  it ’ s too early to determine exactly how deadly or contagious it is , and as the times columnist nicholas kristof has pointed out , the chinese government seems to have tried to play down the outbreak , perhaps undercounting the number of infections and deaths . </s>  a vaccine will probably not be viable

and agencies , such as the c.d.c . </s>  and the national institutes of health , rather than politicians : “ decisions such as border screenings , travel restrictions and potential quarantine have major public health consequences , and they should be driven by science and emerging biological and epidemiological evidence , ” dr. omer writes . </s>  congress also needs to fund the nationwide

response coordinator from 2014 to 2015 , and nicole lurie , a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the department of health and human services . </s>  that funding is set to expire in four months . </s>  the coronavirus could also threaten the global supply chain of pharmaceuticals , ed silverman reports . </s>  roughly 80 percent of active ingredients used by commercial sources to produce finished medicines come from china , he writes . </s>  most ingredient production occurs several hundred miles east of wuhan , but it ’ s not hard to imagine the virus and the quarantine spreading in that direction , bringing with them the possibility of shortages . </s>  “ we need a government entity that monitors global supply and demand — and events like this outbreak — to understand our vulnerabilities , predict possibilities and have a plan to prepare , rather than scramble , ” rosemary gibson , a health care and patient safety expert at the hastings center , told mr. silverman . </s>  “ we track food supplies around the world . </s>  we do this for energy supplies . </s>  we need to do the same thing for medicines. ” ‘ disease and discrimination are two sides of the same coin ’ the first victim of an infectious disease outbreak is often rational decision-making , write mr. klain and ms. lurie , which tends to open the door to discrimination in forms both malicious and misguided . </s>  ann coulter , a right-wing commentator , beseeched president trump on twitter to ban travel from china . </s>  in new york city , one school district canceled a field trip to chinatown ahead of the lunar new year celebrations . </s>  one parent , amy lee-ludovicy , a hong kong native , told the times that she worried her two children were facing discrimination in

passed a bill preventing insiders from siphoning off international aid money through bank bailouts . </s>  the vote was seen as opening the door to international monetary fund lending , desperately needed for ukraine ’ s nose-diving economy , and became a rare success for president volodymyr zelensky . </s>  mr. zelensky , a former comedian elected president last year , had inspired high hopes with his commitment to weeding out corruption . </s>  but those hopes were dimmed this spring when former officials went public with accusations of backsliding and insider dealing , an old scourge in ukraine . </s>  the new bill opening the way for fresh lending from the i.m.f. , for example , came even as courts in ukraine ordered a state bank to pay oligarch-linked offshore companies $ 259 million to settle a contentious lawsuit , suggesting the money might enter one door and leave through another . </s>  the banking bill was intended to plug some of these leaks . </s>  in a speech to parliament , mr. zelensky said it was needed to “ protect ukraine ’ s economy ” as the country negotiates with the i.m.f . </s>  for an $ 8 billion loan . </s>  a major obstacle for the new bill was opposition from ihor kolomoisky , a banking and oil tycoon and former patron of mr. zelensky . </s>  the president has never made a clean break with mr. kolomoisky . </s>  “ reformers worry that a revanche is underway , ” toward oligarchic rule in ukraine , melinda haring , the deputy director of the atlantic council ’ s eurasia center , wrote earlier this month of the zelensky administration ’ s cautiousness in crossing the interests of mr. kolomoisky and other financial heavyweights . </s>  the bill passed on wednesday prohibits the state from returning nationalized banks to their former owners , which seemed to take direct aim at mr. kolomoisky . </s>  in 2016 , the ukrainian government seized and then used a $ 5.5 billion bailout to prop up privatbank , a bank that had been co-owned by mr. kolomoisky . </s>  the bailout cost ukraine more than the entire sum the state budget had received at that point from the i.m.f . </s>  after the country ’ s pro-western revolution two years earlier . </s>  since then , mr. kolomoisky and his allies have been suing to reverse the nationalization and win compensation from the now state-owned , and no longer insolvent , bank . </s>  rather than trust ukrainian courts to ensure no additional i.m.f . </s>  money vanished into mr. kolomoisky ’ s business empire , the fund requested parliament pass the bill prohibiting any reversals of bank nationalizations through the courts . </s>  the preamble to the bill , in fact , states plainly it was passed because of “ imperfections in the court system. ” but it does not close off all access to public money . </s>  when it nationalized privatbank , the ukrainian central bank accused mr. kolomoisky of embezzling money from the bank by lending to so-called “ related parties , ” such as offshore shell companies that regulators said he and associates owned . </s>  pwc , privatbank ’ s auditor , is also contesting the central bank ’ s actions . </s>  the government froze some accounts held by these companies . </s>  now , even as ukraine is asking for additional i.m.f . </s>  funding , ukrainian courts have been awarding multimillion-dollar payouts to these companies and the business associates of mr. kolomoisky under proceedings that will not be stopped by the bill passed wednesday , which only prohibits transfers of shares in banks . </s>  for a poor country in pressing need of medical equipment to counter the coronavirus pandemic , the losses are significant . </s>  the kyiv court of appeals on april 15 , for example , ordered privatbank to pay the $ 259 million to several offshore companies by deciding they were not , in fact , “ related parties. ” a company registered in the name of an ex-wife of one business associate was not related enough , the court ruled . </s>  in another instance , the court held that privatbank and an offshore company sharing a cypriot lawyer was not evidence of any connection . </s>  critics called the ruling a whitewashing of fraud , costing taxpayers and the foreign governments that prop up ukraine millions . </s>  “ it was a money laundering machine , ” daryna kalenyuk , executive director of the anticorruption action center , said of privatbank . </s>  at the same time , several former defenders of mr. zelensky have emerged lately to accuse his administration of insider dealing . </s>  oleksiy honcharuk , a former prime minister during the first months of the administration , said he was fired because he was trying to curb corruption . </s>  and a former prosecutor general , ruslan ryaboshapka , wrote in a blog post that the director of ukraine ’ s domestic intelligence agency , ivan bakanov , a childhood friend of mr. zelensky , had tried to block an investigation into privatbank . </s>  mr. zelensky has said he is still dedicated to cleaning up the government but that the effort has been slowed by pushback within the bureaucracy . </s>  the accusations against mr. zelensky shed some new light on one of the central points of contention during the impeachment process in the united states . </s>  democratic lawmakers said that the trump administration had falsely asserted it withheld military aid for ukraine over concerns of corruption , when , in fact , it was pressuring mr. zelensky to investigate joseph r. biden jr. , now the presumptive democratic nominee for president . </s>  republican defenders of mr. trump , on the other hand , said the administration released the aid only after it was convinced mr. zelensky was indeed dedicated to fighting corruption . </s>  maria varenikova contributed reporting from kyiv , ukraine . </s>    in the last few days , most americans , even president trump , have come to terms with the need for social distancing . </s>  though they feel fine , they are staying home and developing new routines — killing time baking , binge-watching , figuring out how to home-school their kids . </s>  it took far too long for americans to accept how serious the coronavirus is . </s>  now that we ’ ve finally taken the necessary measures in many places to close schools , offices , restaurants and other businesses , people are asking : how soon will it all be over ? </s>  two weeks ? </s>  four weeks ? </s>  when can we go back to normal ? </s>  unfortunately , normal is a long way off . </s>  we need to be thinking in terms of months , not weeks . </s>  we need to stop picturing that ubiquitous “ flatten the curve ” chart and start imagining a roller coaster . </s>  social distancing works . </s>  as china , south korea and other countries have demonstrated , it is possible to slow the spread of the virus and limit how many people are infected at one time . </s>  this will keep hospitals from being overwhelmed with patients , so that those who are sick can be treated competently and compassionately . </s>  it will also give researchers time to work on developing vaccines and medications that could reduce the severity of the virus and save lives . </s>  no one knows for sure how long social distancing will have to last to reduce the spread to near zero . </s>  but if south korea and china are appropriate exemplars , we ’ ll need to stay apart now for at least eight weeks , and maybe more . </s>  china locked down wuhan and other cities in hubei province on jan. 23 . </s>  today , provincial officials are reporting few or no new cases of the virus . </s>  just a few days ago , they closed the last of their 16 makeshift emergency hospitals . </s>  consequently , restrictions are easing . </s>  schools and offices are slowly opening . </s>  people are beginning to go out and see other people . </s>  that timeline suggests that your kids are not going back to school on april 1 . </s>  nor are you returning to the office or catching a movie anytime soon . </s>  plan for social distancing at least until mid- or late may , and be thankful if it eases off earlier . </s>  what can we expect when americans slowly emerge from their homes ? </s>  like much about this novel virus , we don ’ t know for sure . </s>  a likely scenario is that there will be subsequent waves of the disease . </s>  that ’ s what happened in denver in the 1918-19 influenza pandemic and in toronto during the 2003 sars outbreak . </s>  over the next few months , south korea , china and other countries will generate some relevant evidence to show how this might play out . </s>  many people desperately hope that warmer , more humid weather will decrease the transmission of this coronavirus . </s>  but the reality is that influenza and most cold viruses wane in the summer in part because so many people catch them in the winter . </s>  humans have never been infected with this coronavirus before , so there is no acquired immunity . </s>  at this point we have woefully little evidence to suggest a seasonal reprieve . </s>  we assume that people who are infected and then recover , whether they develop symptoms or not , will most likely become immune and will not transmit the virus in the future . </s>  ( though it is possible , as with other types of coronavirus , that mild infections might not provide full immunity in the short term or lifelong immunity . ) </s>  the irony of successful social distancing is that fewer will develop immunity . </s>  that means that social distancing 2.0 , 3.0 and , who knows , maybe even 4.0 will very likely have to occur . </s>  the next round of social distancing will be activated more rapidly , because officials — and the public — will be more prepared . </s>  it should also be shorter , because we can assume that most of the people who were initially infected are likely to be immune next time around . </s>  but it will still disrupt people ’ s lives and the economy . </s>  we will still have canceled conferences and sporting events . </s>  people will not frequent restaurants and will not travel . </s>  the service industry will be severely curtailed . </s>  and it ’ s going to happen again and again . </s>  maybe the best analogy is pumping a car ’ s brakes on an icy road . </s>  either doing nothing or slamming on the brakes leads to an accident . </s>  so we pump the brakes — pushing on the brakes , then easing up , and then applying them again — and after three or four times we slow down enough to stop . </s>  when will the coronavirus be tamed like influenza , if not conquered like smallpox ? </s>  a vaccine would need to be administered to an estimated 45 percent to 70 percent of the population — at least 145 million people — to stop the spread of the virus . </s>  if we are lucky , and an effective vaccine is quickly developed , this could happen by the fall of 2021 . </s>  it might even be sooner if researchers can come up with an effective treatment that , in addition to preventing deaths , reduces the infectiousness of each case . </s>  one antiviral drug , remdesivir , has shown promise in treating monkeys infected with a similar coronavirus , and is being studied in humans . </s>  trials of other drugs will begin soon . </s>  again , if we are lucky , these trials may identify one or more effective treatments in four to five months . </s>  the alternative to this roller coaster would be even more drastic . </s>  it would require sustaining social distancing until there are no more cases whatsoever and then closing borders to all travelers — no contact with the outside world — for 18 months or more . </s>  while the united states and many other countries , like denmark and germany , have instituted travel bans , sealing the country off for over a year until a coronavirus vaccine is discovered seems implausible . </s>  but who knows . </s>  if the situation becomes dire enough , the previously impossible could become inevitable . </s>  on a positive note , each time the virus resurges after social distancing is relaxed , it will do so more slowly . </s>  but the flattened curve we are all hoping for — the one that is so critical to our health care infrastructure — will not actually be flat . </s>  it is more likely to be a series of ascents and descents , with dampened oscillations . </s>  so all of us — health care workers , policymakers and american citizens — need to get ready for a bumpy ride . </s>  ezekiel j. emanuel is the chairman of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the

coronavirus outbreak , was hard won . </s>  in 2018 , new caps on state , local and property tax deductions disproportionately affected high-price markets like new york , and a series of tax changes in 2019 , including increased transfer taxes for luxury apartments , further stalled the market . </s>  new tenant-friendly rent laws passed last summer , the possibility of new taxes on pieds-à-terre

affected areas have begun to take precautions at the behest of families and experts . </s>  as this new disease spreads , it has become equally important for all of us to ask what steps are being taken to protect the health of people in jails and prisons , and the staff who work in them . </s>  the american criminal legal system holds almost 2.3 million people in prisons , jails , detention centers and psychiatric hospitals . </s>  and they do not live under quarantine : jails experience a daily influx of correctional staff , vendors , health care workers , educators and visitors — all of whom carry viral conditions at the prison back to their homes and communities and return the next day packing the germs from back home . </s>  how will we prevent incarcerated people and those who work in these institutions from becoming ill and spreading the virus ? </s>  this week , the harris county juvenile court in houston announced that the court wing will be fully closed to all until further notice , after officials reported that a person who had been in the court may test positive for coronavirus . </s>  and an employee at a correctional facility in pennsylvania also tested positive for covid-19 . </s>  thirty-four inmates and staffers there are now in quarantine . </s>  on friday , the federal department of correction announced that incarcerated people at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will not be allowed visits from family , friends or attorneys for 30 days , in response to the threat of the coronavirus . </s>  but this ethical sacrifice raises more questions than it answers about the broader set of changes that will be required to limit this contagion while protecting the rights of incarcerated people . </s>  in america ’ s jails and prisons , people share bathrooms , laundry and eating areas . </s>  the toilets in their cells rarely have lids . </s>  the toilet tank doubles as the sink for hand washing , tooth brushing and other hygiene . </s>  people bunked in the same cell — often as many as four — share these toilets and sinks . </s>  meanwhile , hand sanitizer is not allowed in most prisons because of its alcohol content . </s>  air circulation is nearly always poor . </s>  windows rarely open ; soap may only be available if you can pay for it from the commissary . </s>  these deficiencies , inhumane in and of themselves , now represent a threat to anyone with a jail in their community — and there is a jail in almost every county in the united states . </s>  according to health experts , it is not a matter of if , but when , this virus breaks out in jails and prisons . </s>  people are constantly churning through jail and prison facilities , being ushered to court hearings , and then being released to their communities — nearly 11 million every year . </s>  “ we should recall that we have 5,000 jails and prisons full of people with high rates of health problems , and where health services are often inadequate and disconnected from the community systems directing the coronavirus response , ” said dr. homer venters , former chief medical officer of the new york city jail system . </s>  “ coronavirus in these settings will dramatically increase the epidemic curve , not flatten it , and disproportionately for people of color. ” jails are particularly frightening in this pandemic because of their massive turnover . </s>  while over 600,000 people enter prison gates annually , there are about 612,000 people in jail on any given day . </s>  more than half of the people in jail are only in there for two to three days . </s>  in some communities , the county jail or prison is a major employer . </s>  jail staff members are also notoriously underpaid , may not have paid sick leave and are more likely to live in apartments , in close and frequent contact with neighbors . </s>  they return home daily to aging parents , pregnant partners or family members with chronic conditions . </s>  our penal system should have received more comprehensive guidance and material support from the department of justice , far earlier in this crisis . </s>  like much of the federal level response , it is falling short . </s>  encouragingly , others have taken the lead . </s>  the san francisco district attorney , chesa boudin , together with the public defender , manohar raju , were the first to take proactive steps to release as many people as safely possible who are at heightened risk from coronavirus . </s>  mr. boudin directed his prosecutors not to oppose release motions for misdemeanor or nonviolent felony pretrial detainees where the person poses no threat to public safety . </s>  “ we are trying to absorb information from countries who have experienced the covid-19 pandemic before us , ” said dr. alysse wurcel , an infectious diseases physician at tufts medical center and at six county jails in eastern massachusetts . </s>  “ but since the united states has the highest incarceration rate in the world , it is difficult to extrapolate the potential impact. ” american officials can learn from the harrowing story of south korea ’ s daenam hospital . </s>  in late february , south korea had already reported more than 3,150 confirmed cases , and of these , 101 were from patients in the daenam psychiatric ward . </s>  seven of these patients have now died . </s>  all but two patients in the ward contracted covid-19 . </s>  the ward was put on lockdown , in an attempt to confine the spread of the virus . </s>  instead , the lockdown issued was a death sentence to many inside . </s>  across the united states , activists for prisoners ’ rights have repeatedly requested plans to protect against an outbreak in prisons . </s>  still , only a few jurisdictions have released plans . </s>  some make good sense — one from the new york city department of correction includes screening people for flulike symptoms before placing them in group holding cells , and sending people who have flulike symptoms to a communicable diseases unit for treatment . </s>  but those steps do not go far enough , nor do they affirmatively indicate an understanding of the ways this virus spreads : will the incarcerated laborers now creating “ nys clean , ” the new york state government-manufactured hand sanitizer , be wearing n95 masks and gloves ? </s>  the plan indicates that people incarcerated in dormitories on rikers island are being asked to sleep head to toe and three feet apart in the bunks , as if this short distance could prevent the spread of the virus if it ’ s present . </s>  it won ’ t . </s>  there are yet more reasons to be concerned . </s>  with about 40 percent of incarcerated people suffering from a chronic health condition , the overall health profile of people in jails and prisons is abysmal . </s>  and the older prison population is among the most vulnerable to severe complications from covid-19 . </s>  there are 274,000 people aged 50 or older in state and federal prisons in the united states . </s>  if this group were separated from the rest of the u.s. prison population , they would be the seventh-largest prison system in the world . </s>  aging people who are released after serving long sentences have a recidivism rate close to zero . </s>  governors and other public officials should consider a one-time review of all elderly or infirm people in prisons , providing immediate medical furloughs or compassionate release to as many of them as possible . </s>  it is also critical that jails take swift action to reduce the number of people in confinement . </s>  local law enforcement can safely reduce these numbers in several ways : these include reclassifying misdemeanor and lower-level felony offenses that do not threaten public safety into non-jailable offenses , using citations instead of arrests for all low-level crime and indefinitely postponing all parole and probation office visits . </s>  this crisis demands that prison and jail staff members be trained in methods to prevent transmission . </s>  and the diagnostic tests for the virus , which have been extremely slow to roll out , should make their way to jails and prisons too . </s>  incarcerated people who test positive for the coronavirus should be offered immediate access to free , high-quality health care . </s>  and anyone in jail in pretrial detention ( which means they haven ’ t been convicted of anything and most likely just can not afford bail ) , who can be safely released , should be released . </s>  to do

a fever , cough and the “ ground glass opacities ” in both lungs that are a trademark of infection with the new coronavirus . </s>  two days later , his condition suddenly worsened and his oxygen levels dropped . </s>  his body , doctors suspected , was in the grip of a cytokine storm , a dangerous overreaction of the immune system . </s>  the phenomenon has become all too common in the coronavirus pandemic , but it is also pointing to potentially helpful drug treatments . </s>  when the body first encounters a virus or a bacterium , the immune system ramps up and begins to fight the invader . </s>  the foot soldiers in this fight are molecules called cytokines that set off a cascade of signals to cells to marshal a response . </s>  usually , the stronger this immune response , the stronger the chance of vanquishing the infection , which is partly why children and younger people are less vulnerable over all to coronavirus . </s>  and once the enemy is defeated , the immune system is hard-wired to shut itself off . </s>  “ for most people and most infections , that ’ s what happens , ” said dr. randy cron , an expert on cytokine storms at the university of alabama at birmingham . </s>  but in some cases — as much as 15 percent of people battling any serious infection , according to dr. cron ’ s team — the immune system keeps raging long after the virus is no longer a threat . </s>  it continues to release cytokines that keep the body on an exhausting full alert . </s>  in their misguided bid to keep the body safe , these cytokines attack multiple organs including the lungs and liver , and may eventually lead to death . </s>  in these people , it ’ s their body ’ s response , rather than the virus , that ultimately causes harm . </s>  cytokine storms can overtake people of any age , but some scientists believe that they may explain why healthy young people died during the 1918 pandemic and more recently during the sars , mers and h1n1 epidemics . </s>  they are also a complication of various autoimmune diseases like lupus and still ’ s disease , a form of arthritis . </s>  and they may offer clues as to why otherwise healthy young people with coronavirus infection are succumbing to acute respiratory distress syndrome , a common consequence of a cytokine storm . </s>  reports from china and italy have described young patients with clinical outcomes that seem consistent with this phenomenon . </s>  it ’ s very likely that some of these patients developed a cytokine storm , dr. cron said . </s>  in the case of the 42-year-old patient , the suspected cytokine storm led his doctors to eventually try tocilizumab , a drug they have sometimes used to soothe an immune system in distress . </s>  after just two doses of the drug , spaced eight hours apart , the patient ’ s fever rapidly disappeared , his oxygen levels rose and a chest scan showed his lungs clearing . </s>  the case report , described in an upcoming paper in annals of oncology , joins dozens of accounts from italy and china , all indicating that tocilizumab might be an effective antidote to the coronavirus in some people . </s>  on march 5 , china approved the drug to treat serious cases of covid-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus , and authorized clinical trials . </s>  on march 23 , the u.s. food and drug administration granted approval to the pharmaceutical company roche to test the drug in hundreds of people with coronavirus infection . </s>  tocilizumab is approved to quieten the chatter of immune molecules in rheumatoid arthritis and in some types of cancer . </s>  it mutes the activity of a specific cytokine called interleukin-6 that is associated with an over-exuberant immune response . </s>  “ that ’ s the rationale for using the drug , ” said dr. laurence albiges , who cared for the patient at the gustave roussy cancer center in paris . </s>  even as researchers look for treatments , they are trying to learn more about why some people ’ s immune systems go into this dangerous overdrive . </s>  genetic factors explain the risk , at least in some kinds of cytokine storms . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates

immune molecules , and may all result in the fatal shutdown of multiple organs . </s>  but many doctors are unfamiliar with this niche concept or how to treat it , experts said . </s>  “ everyone ’ s talking about cytokine storm as if it were a well-recognized phenomenon , but you could have asked medics two weeks ago and they wouldn ’ t have heard of it , ” said dr. jessica manson , an immunologist at university college london hospital . </s>  a patient battling a cytokine storm may have an abnormally fast heart rate , fever and a drop in blood pressure . </s>  apart from a surge in interleukin-6 , the body may also show high swirling levels of molecules called interleukin-1 , interferon-gamma , c-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-alpha . </s>  this storm , if it develops , becomes obvious a few days into the infection . </s>  but the sooner doctors catch on to it and treat it , the more likely the patient is to survive . </s>  too late , and the storm may be

to mr. garcia ’ s victory as a sign that president trump still has support in the kinds of suburban areas that democrats are depending on to win back the white house . </s>  mr. trump had repeatedly weighed in on the race , endorsing mr. garcia even as he suggested the election was “ rigged ” by democrats in the state . </s>  long before the coronavirus pandemic , democrats tried to portray the race as a referendum on mr. trump , a strategy they thought would resonate in the district , where hillary clinton won in 2016 by nearly seven points . </s>  but mr. garcia was seen as a top-notch republican recruit in the district , where latinos make up the second-largest group of voters . </s>  in recent years , the party has struggled to shore up its support from latino and asian voters in such diverse suburban districts of southern california . </s>  in 2018 , liberal activists from los angeles enthusiastically flocked to the district to knock on doors and register new voters , which helped to fuel one of the most high-profile victories for democrats in the midterm elections . </s>  democrats had privately worried that ms. hill ’ s resignation left the party vulnerable in the district . </s>  and republicans had moved quickly : mr. garcia campaigned for more than a year and leaned heavily on his biography . </s>  california is now set to conduct the november election primarily through the mail , and tuesday ’ s contest was a practice run , with in-person voting centers mostly setup outdoors in parking lots . </s>  the debate over mail-in voting has grown increasingly rancorous and partisan , with republicans portraying it as ripe for fraud , without evidence . </s>  mr. garcia had declared victory wednesday morning , saying in a statement “ i ’ m

however , there were next to none . </s>  the scene was replicated on the shopping boulevards of paris , in the malls of dubai and on the streets of hong kong . </s>  the coronavirus has caused the quarantine of more than 50 million people in china , and travel and visa restrictions to more than 70 countries . </s>  alongside widespread shutdowns of stores and malls in china , it has taken a heavy toll on the global luxury goods sector , long dependent on the spending of chinese shoppers at home and abroad . </s>  some fear that the sector could be facing its worst crisis since the global financial meltdown of 2008 . </s>  the investment bank jefferies estimates that chinese buyers accounted for 40 percent of the 281 billion euros , or $ 305 billion , spent on luxury goods globally last year , and drove 80 percent of the past year ’ s sales growth in the sector , making them the fastest-growing luxury shopper demographic in the world . </s>  now , with the latest season of

impossible at this time to fully evaluate the impact on business and how fast it will recover , ” he said . </s>  despite posting robust quarterly results , kering , owner of names like gucci , saint laurent and alexander mcqueen , had seen “ a serious drop in traffic in mainland china , ” mr. pinault said , and a “ strong drop ” in global sales in recent days because of the virus . </s>  burberry , which derives about two-fifths of its sales from chinese consumers , has said the effect of the virus is worse than the disruption caused by the hong kong protests , which halved sales for the british luxury brand in its last fiscal quarter . </s>  roughly a third of burberry stores in mainland china have been shut , the company said in a statement , while foot traffic had plunged 80

the sector than the sars epidemic did in 2003 , given how much more reliant brands are on china and asia for sales growth. ” concerns are also growing around the effect on consumer morale . </s>

given that china is the world ’ s largest textile producer , with exports worth more than $ 280 billion a year , some analysts think shortages may soon become apparent in stores , even though the fashion industry often orders goods further in advance than many other sectors , owing to seasonal collection cycles . </s>  “ the next few weeks should be critical , as further delays in the restart of production could begin to result in out-of-stocks at u.s. shelves as early as mid-april , ” the wells fargo analyst edward kelly said in a note to investors . </s>  regardless of widespread jitters about the short-term disruption caused by the virus , key luxury stocks like lvmh and kering have remained relatively resilient . </s>  most analysts think that well-managed luxury brands with enduring popularity and high margins should be able to withstand the short-term volatility . </s>  concern is reserved for hard luxury players ( groups , like richemont , that largely sell watches and jewelry ) and midmarket labels with less ability to absorb financial shocks or that were already seeing sluggish sales . </s>  assuming a 20 percent drop in chinese consumption in the second quarter of 2020 , ubs predicts a 3 percent decrease in earnings per share for brands like lvmh and hermès , compared with 8 percent for richemont and 7 percent for burberry , which has a particularly high

within 72 hours . </s>  after that , officials said , the cleaning process would begin again . </s>  new jersey transit , which operates its own vast commuter rail and bus network , is also strengthening its cleaning regimen , using bleach or other anti-viral cleaning supplies to disinfect equipment and public facilities . </s>  the agency recently formed an internal task force , which includes workers from its medical staff , to monitor news about the virus , officials said . </s>  in other major cities experiencing outbreaks , transit officials have taken similar precautions . </s>  in tehran , public health officials have said they are disinfecting buses at least four times a day and cleaning trains in the city ’ s subway system at the beginning and end of each line . </s>  in italy , buses , trains and ferries are also being disinfected regularly . </s>  what happens if things get worse ? </s>  if the outbreak becomes more serious , health officials may recommend that public transit officials adopt more drastic measures . </s>  they could suggest steps to reduce crowds like limiting people ’ s use of subways and buses to travel that is absolutely essential , like going to and from work , or changing train schedules to discourage travel during peak hours . </s>  even in a severe pandemic , the c.d.c . </s>  recommends that essential services like public transit continue to operate so that health care workers and other emergency responders can get to work . </s>  it is more likely that city officials would try to reduce the use of public transportation by

</s>    washington — democratic leaders plan to move this week to change the rules of the house of representatives to allow lawmakers to cast votes remotely for the first time in its 231-year history , a major concession to the constraints created by the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  representative steny h. hoyer , democrat of maryland and the majority leader , advised lawmakers on tuesday that they were likely to vote on thursday on the new rules , which would temporarily allow members to designate another lawmaker to cast votes for them by proxy if they are unable to travel to the capitol themselves . </s>  he framed it as a common-sense decision to help the 430-member body function more smoothly as the virus alters american life and forces millions of people to shelter in place to slow its spread . </s>  “ we want to be able to do the people ’ s work , notwithstanding the directions to remain at distance , ” mr. hoyer told reporters on tuesday . </s>  house republican leaders said they were opposed to the plan , and urged their members to vote against it . </s>  either way , democrats have more than enough votes to push through the change themselves . </s>  the republican-controlled senate , a smaller , clubbier body whose members are even more reluctant to dispatch with tradition , is unlikely to follow suit . </s>  senator mitch mcconnell , republican of kentucky and the majority leader , has firmly rejected the idea . </s>  on tuesday afternoon , after the senate passed a $ 484 billion coronavirus relief bill by voice vote — the only way to do business since most senators are absent from the capital — senator rand paul , republican of kentucky , tried unsuccessfully to force a change in the rules to allow emergency remote voting . </s>  mr. mcconnell blocked the move . </s>  the coming changes in the house have been weeks in the making . </s>  many of the chamber ’ s younger members have been arguing aggressively that remote voting would model good behavior for the country , keep their older colleagues — one-third of the house members are at least 65 — safe and allow for greater continuity in a time of national crisis . </s>  but the leaders had been hesitant to discard precedent , particularly when congress is being called upon to enact sweeping policies to respond to the virus . </s>  under its current rules , the house can pass measures only if no lawmaker objects or if members travel to vote in person , as they are expected to do on thursday when , in addition to the rules change , the house will consider the $ 484 billion relief package for small businesses straining under the effects of the pandemic . </s>  the proxy voting arrangement is something of a low-tech compromise between competing proposals for how to proceed . </s>  under the current plan , devised by representative jim mcgovern , democrat of massachusetts and the chairman of the rules committee , any member of congress could submit his or her vote to the house in writing . </s>  it would then be entered into the record by another lawmaker present in the capitol , who would not be allowed to change his or her colleague ’ s vote . </s>  still , many republicans have chafed at the plan and could oppose thursday ’ s vote en masse . </s>  republican leaders indicated they were irked that the democrats did not bring them further into the planning process , but many of their members said they simply saw no reason for congress not to show up in person when other essential workers all over the country , including president trump , are doing so . </s>  “ we should be here in person to vote , ” said representative andy harris , republican of maryland . </s>  “ that ’ s the way it ’ s been done for 200 years . </s>  that ’ s the way

republican anxiety is mr. kobach , the former kansas secretary of state who lost the 2018 governor ’ s race to laura kelly , a democrat , despite an endorsement from mr. trump . </s>  he is admired by supporters and reviled by detractors for his severe views on immigration and voting rights — a law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration , pressed by mr. kobach , was recently rejected by a federal appeals court . </s>  “ he had no ability to raise the money , to consolidate the different wings of his party , and to turn out any votes — besides that , he did great , ” said scott w.

of statewide leaders including former senator bob dole — is seeking to emerge as the consensus choice , and there are increasing signs that key party leaders and groups are inclined to coalesce around him . </s>  mr. marshall is armed with an endorsement from mr. dole , who remains beloved by many kansans , and support from a growing list of significant organizations , including the kansas farm bureau . </s>  and anti-kobach republicans see him as a more traditional if deeply conservative candidate who doesn ’ t inspire the same visceral reactions mr. kobach does . </s>  “ there are lots of people that have been concerned about this , ” said former gov . </s>  jeff colyer , a republican whom mr. kobach narrowly defeated in the 2018 gubernatorial primary . </s>  “ i ’ m supporting congressman marshall because he ’ s the one who can most readily , stably defend the seat. ” mr. marshall , an obstetrician-gynecologist , is emphasizing his strong opposition to abortion rights , his work on agricultural matters and his support of mr. trump . </s>  “ if we kansans send the wrong person to the general election , it could be competitive , ” mr. marshall said in an interview . </s>  “ i just don ’ t think kansans will make that mistake twice. ” asked about engaging moderate republicans who are uncomfortable with mr. trump , he replied , “ well , goodness , that wouldn ’ t be very

the firm public opinion strategies — for mr. marshall ’ s campaign — showed him with a primary lead over mr. kobach , a reversal of march numbers that had shown mr. kobach , who is well known in the state and boasts a base of devoted supporters , ahead . </s>  but some national republicans are unenthusiastic about mr. marshall , and underwhelmed by his fund-raising . </s>  the political arm of

kobach , whom mr. mcintosh called a “ strong conservative , ” saying earlier this month that the organization was reserving judgment to see what kind of campaign mr. kobach would assemble . </s>  several other republicans are running . </s>  in a controversial move , mr. kuckelman , the state chairman , asked all of them to drop out except for mr. marshall and mr. kobach — either by sending letters , as the kansas city star reported , or in other conversations , mr. kuckelman said . </s>  it struck some observers as an effort to thwart mr. kobach by thinning the field , and as a sign of republican anxiety about the seat . </s>  on thursday , state senate president susan wagle said she would not file for the race , citing conversations with national party leaders and a belief that “ a divisive primary will only benefit the campaign of barbara bollier. ” mr. kuckelman said he was focused on limiting infighting . </s>  but he acknowledged that he had heard concerns about mr. kobach , including about his potentially negative effect on republican candidates in other races , though he said he had no data to prove that . </s>  “ i have absolutely seen those comments and i understand them and i will not be without a plan , ” he said . </s>  in an interview , mr. kobach dismissed those who said his 2018 performance was predictive of his 2020 general election viability ; he pointed out that kansas had elected several democratic governors in recent years . </s>  he learned new tactics from his defeat , he said , and suggested that the kansas electorate that shows up for mr. trump

entered his small apartment in the far rockaway section of the borough and saw his three young children , their eyes longing for a fatherly hug , he fought every instinct to wrap his arms around them . </s>  “ i froze , ” mr. darhan , 34 , said . </s>  “ i wanted to hug them , but it did not feel safe . </s>  i don ’ t know when i would feel safe hugging them again. ” mr. darhan ’ s misgivings underscore the difficulties of returning to normal life after surviving a disease that has changed almost every aspect of living in new york city . </s>  there have been virus cases in 55 new jersey nursing homes . </s>  new jersey ’ s 375 long-term health care facilities and nursing homes have had no-visitor policies in place for nearly two weeks . </s>  but on friday , 55 nursing homes in the state had reported that at least one patient had tested positive for the coronavirus , up from 43 on thursday . </s>  nineteen of the 108 people that died in new jersey after contracting the virus were recently treated in a nursing home , according to alexandra altman , a spokeswoman for govenor murphy . </s>  two of the hardest-hit facilities , family of caring in montclair and st. joseph ’ s senior home in woodbridge , are now considered sites of “ outbreaks , ” she said . </s>  eleven recent deaths have been linked to family of caring . </s>  six of those who died had tested positive for the virus ; others died before their test results were returned or died of a respiratory illness before being tested . </s>  officials at family of caring at montclair , which remained open , did not return calls . </s>  st. joseph ’ s closed on wednesday after evacuating its 94 patients , most of whom were moved to a nursing home about a half-hour away . </s>  reporting was contributed by jonah engel bromwich , alan feuer , michael gold , christina goldbaum , nicole hong , jesse mckinley , andy newman , sarah maslin nir , sharon otterman , luis ferré-sadurní , edgar sandoval and tracey tully . </s>    paris — for much of the last two months , paris has been empty — its shops and cafes shuttered , its streets deserted , its millions of tourists suddenly evaporated . </s>  freed of people , the urban landscape has evoked an older paris . </s>  in particular , it has called up the singular paris of eugène atget , an early 20th-century father of modern photography in his unsentimental focus on detail . </s>  in thousands of pictures , atget shot an empty city , getting up early each morning and lugging his primitive equipment throughout the streets . </s>  his images reduced paris to its architectural essence . </s>  mauricio lima has followed in atget ’ s footsteps , shooting images of the same scenes his famous predecessor captured . </s>  but this time those streets are deserted because of the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  mr. lima ’ s recreations offer new insight into atget ’ s work — and into the meaning of a city unique in its beauty but also in its coldness . </s>  the critic and philosopher walter benjamin famously invoked crime scenes in discussing atget ’ s photographs . </s>  he was pointing to their emptiness , their clinical attention to details of the urban landscape , their absolute rejection of the sentimental and the grandiose . </s>  as benjamin observed , atget established a beneficial “ distance between man and his environment. ” and mr. lima ’ s haunting updated recreations confirm the long-dead photographer ’ s disquieting insight — paris doesn ’ t care about your presence . </s>  it is indifferent , and will certainly go on without you . </s>  you can feel joy at standing on a paris street , but the feeling is not reciprocated . </s>  atget , who was born in 1857 , initially tried unsuccessfully at acting and painting . </s>  in 1890 , he set up shop as a photographer , in order — as a sign over his door said — to provide “ documents for artists. ” he knew that painters needed images as models for their work , and he set about furnishing them . </s>  for nearly three decades , he trudged through the city , bearing his heavy tripod and documenting a paris of narrow streets and grime-covered low buildings that was already disappearing . </s>  in 1920 , atget wrote : “ i can say that i possess all of old paris. ” the world was mostly indifferent to atget ’ s work until , several years before his death in 1927 , he met a young american photographer , berenice abbott , who was working as an assistant to the artist man ray . </s>  she photographed him , wrote about him , acquired many of his prints and promoted him relentlessly for 50 years . </s>  today , atget is recognized as a major figure in the history of photography . </s>  the empty paris of his prints looms out of the half-light of what seems like perpetual fog . </s>  his buildings are independent of people . </s>  they don ’ t even need them . </s>  paris , the message seems to be , continues . </s>  it does not care about the individual presence . </s>  the city is not sentimental about humankind . </s>  true , traces of humanity are ever-present in his pictures — torn advertising posters , artisanal shop signs , bins of vegetables , rows of boots . </s>  but these are only reminders that the city might once have been inhabited . </s>  and there are few people in the images to confirm this . </s>  in atget ’ s paris , “ the city is evacuated , like an apartment that hasn ’ t yet found its new tenant , ” benjamin wrote . </s>  compare that with the images from today . </s>  the occasional masked figures are incidental to the landscape . </s>  that they wear masks , hiding part of their faces , is a further denial of their humanity . </s>  the urban landscape asserts its presence , independent of people . </s>  in the present-day photograph of the strange angle at the corner of the rue de seine , in the now-fashionable 6th arrondissement — one of atget ’ s most famous images — the building seems to jut insolently out of the sky , like a kind of sculpture . </s>  the lonely cyclist on the rue de l ’ hôtel de ville emphasizes the street ’ s emptiness , as does the small dog in front of 14 rue servandoni . </s>  the brighter light of the current pictures emphasizes the cold , hard angles of the stone on the rue de la bûcherie . </s>  paris seems more indifferent than ever . </s>  it is also evident in the present-day photographs that paris has been mightily cleaned up . </s>  the accumulated grime and soot of centuries — still present in the 1960s — has been washed away . </s>  the blackened facades , so prominent in photographs of paris during the german occupation in world war ii , are now white . </s>  the advertising posters that once plastered many of the facades are long gone . </s>  walls have been smoothed over , resurfaced , repainted . </s>  paris is no longer a city of working people . </s>  the carpenters , cobblers , chimney-sweeps , vegetable-ladies and porters whose presence is evoked , if not always represented , in atget ’ s pictures are long since gone . </s>  the rue de seine , with its rooftop gardens and chic storefronts , is now one of the pricier bits of the city . </s>  it certainly doesn ’ t look like that in atget ’ s print . </s>  but in today ’ s pictures , paris has been prettified and gentrified . </s>  the “ picturesque ” — which atget shunned , as benjamin points out — is more difficult to avoid . </s>  difficult but , in the time of the coronavirus , perhaps not impossible . </s>    times insider explains who we are and what we do , and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together . </s>  for years , technology has influenced every facet of modern life . </s>  but the coronavirus pandemic , which has forced many people to work , attend school and socialize through screens , has underscored just how entwined technology has become in our lives . </s>  a new daily newsletter , on tech , examines our changing relationship to technology and the effect it is having on us . </s>  shira ovide , who writes the newsletter , sees technology as a topic that encompasses everything from the gadgets we use to what we do on the internet to the decisions big tech companies make . </s>  that ’ s broad , but ms. ovide hopes to show the many ways technology relates to readers ’ lives and livelihoods . </s>  to help contextualize those issues for readers , ms. ovide speaks regularly with other times journalists who cover technology as it relates to elections , the environment and privacy . </s>  recently , ms. ovide spoke on the phone about her goals for the newsletter and what readers can expect in the weeks ahead . </s>  these are edited excerpts . </s>  most of us times employees are working remotely right now . </s>  where are you working from these days ? </s>  i am working remotely from my one-bedroom apartment in new york . </s>  my dining table where i eat meals has now become my workstation . </s>  my laptop is right now parked on top of a shoe box because it positions the video camera in my line of sight for video meetings . </s>  and i ’ m sitting on a crappy desk chair that hurts my back . </s>  so i have a pillow . </s>  it ’ s all not ideal . </s>  you ’ re just a couple of weeks into writing on tech . </s>  how ’ s it going so far ? </s>  i think the answer to everything now is it ’ s going ok under the circumstances . </s>  in a way , this was not exactly the newsletter i expected to be writing . </s>  i thought that this would be a normal year for technology and we ’ d be writing a lot about powerful big tech companies and the role of technology in the presidential election . </s>  and like everything else , this has become an all-coronavirus affair . </s>  how has the pandemic changed your vision for the newsletter ? </s>  the subject matter is different than i intended . </s>  but the vision really hasn ’ t changed . </s>  the idea that we started out with was : technology is reshaping our lives and world in ways that are both obvious and not obvious . </s>  we were tasked with being this useful guide to people to help them understand how technology relates to everything they see in front of them : their jobs , the nature of work , their relationships with their friends and family members . </s>  you know , just all these big and small ways that technology is changing and influencing things . </s>  right now , there ’ s only life mediated through technology . </s>  so in a way , it ’ s made it much more clear how much we rely on technology in ways that are both good and bad . </s>  technology is a huge topic . </s>  you have the consumer side of tech , the business side and the actual technology that makes those products and companies possible . </s>  how do you decide what to cover ? </s>  there ’ s both an opportunity and a challenge when technology is sort of this broad subject that means everything and nothing . </s>  to some people , technology is this narrow thing that just means computers , smartphones and other kinds of gadgets or the things that are happening on the internet . </s>  and obviously , we ’ re going to write about all of that . </s>  but part of the point here is to show that there is this broad world of what technology means . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates updated jan. 27 , 2021 , 8:53 p.m . </s>  et whitmer pleads with michigan lawmakers to find common ground amid the pandemic . </s>  ‘ tomorrow our fridges will be empty , ’ one european health official says as vaccines dwindle . </s>  biden plans to reopen obamacare exchanges in many states . </s>  how often do you talk to other tech reporters at the times ? </s>  a lot [ laughs ] . </s>  this newsletter was intended to be a product of the entire newsroom at the times , and also the opinion section . </s>  all of our colleagues are writing about the role of technology in the world , way beyond the tech or business stuff . </s>  the people who write about west africa are writing about technology and drone delivery of medicine . </s>  the politics reporters are writing about the role of technology in campaigns . </s>  environmental reporters are writing about the environmental impact of various technologies or e-commerce . </s>  so the idea from the beginning was that this should show the breadth of the work that the times does on technology and that it is intended to be a collegial newsletter . </s>  some of the previous on tech newsletters have included interviews with colleagues , while others have had written sections . </s>  how are you thinking about the structure of the newsletter ? </s>  this is definitely going to evolve as we go on . </s>  i suspect the newsletter is going to look pretty different in a year than it does today . </s>  but i have tried to make this a mix of my voice on things , the expertise of my colleagues and outside experts through interview-style pieces . </s>  the great thing about the times is that there are basically experts on every subject matter . </s>  and so , rather than me writing about digital privacy , why don ’ t i talk to charlie warzel or jennifer valentino-devries , a couple of our colleagues whose life ’ s work is basically writing about digital privacy issues . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › let us help you better understand the coronavirus are coronavirus case counts rising in your region ? </s>  our maps will help you determine how your state , county or country is fairing . </s>  vaccines are rolling out and will reach many of us by spring . </s>  we ’ ve answered some common questions about the vaccines . </s>  now that we are all getting used to living in a pandemic , you may have new questions about how to go about your routine safely , how your children will be impacted , how to travel and more . </s>  we ’ re answering those questions as well . </s>  so far , the coronavirus outbreak has sickened more than 95 million people globally . </s>  more than 2 million people have died . </s>  a timeline of the events that led to these numbers may help you understand how we got here . </s>  what are you paying particular attention to right now ? </s>  the power of big technology companies : what does it mean for a handful of companies to have so much influence on the information people see , what products people buy and how we all interact with each other ? </s>  the other thing i try to talk about a lot is evaluating trade-offs . </s>  any meaningful change is basically a set of drawbacks and benefits . </s>  for example , with facial recognition , how far are we willing to go to keep ourselves or others safe at the expense of privacy or the risk of people getting incorrectly identified as criminals ? </s>  there ’ s also , i think , a fallacy that technology is somehow magic , that it always works and that it ’ s perfect . </s>  and i think that ’ s a little bit of a dangerous trap . </s>  we forget that technology is made by humans . </s>  and humans are fallible . </s>  a phrase that you will see me write a lot is , “ technology is not magic. ” we forget about that all the time . </s>  i think we ’ re seeing that now with the coronavirus , too . </s>  there ’ s been a lot of discussion about the ways that technology in our phones , for example , can help . </s>  if i come down with covid-19 , my phone can log all the people that i ’ ve come in contact with over the previous week and who may be at risk . </s>  i think there ’ s this feeling that either , “ oh , that ’ s super creepy , ” or “ yes , do that . </s>  that sounds like a perfect solution. ” and neither one is true . </s>  how do you use technology in your own reporting ? </s>  i think i ’ m pretty old-school . </s>  i am staring at a reporter ’ s notebook that ’ s in front of me . </s>  i still use a lot of paper and pens . </s>  there are things i use to write and to pay attention to news : i ’ m on twitter quite a lot , i ’ m on slack quite a lot with my colleagues . </s>  but in terms of reporting , i still call a lot of people on the phone . </s>  i don ’ t think i ’ m a person who talks on the phone a lot in my personal life . </s>  but as a reporter , i am much better doing interviews over the phone than i am in person . </s>  and i think that i ’ ve become habituated to engaging with sources over the phone . </s>  that ’ s probably the majority of the conversations that i have . </s>  and so that is my reporter mode : on the telephone . </s>  how do you use technology in your own life ? </s>  twitter is my main habit . </s>  i tried really hard to limit my exposure to other kinds of social media , because i am one of those people who can become addicted to things . </s>  i said to a colleague today that i ’ m probably going to come out of this pandemic addicted to tiktok because it just feels like such an antidote to everything horrible in the world right now . </s>  tiktok feels like this place of creative joy . </s>  there is this virtual cycling app called zwift . </s>  i can turn my bicycle into a fixed exercise bicycle , connect it to this app , and cycle in “ central park ” and ride with other virtual people at the same time . </s>  and i ’ ve been watching a ton of shows on netflix . </s>  what do you want readers to take away from on tech ? </s>  i sometimes say that we ’ re basically showing people the matrix in the keanu reeves sense of the word . </s>  the idea is to show that tech is really everything and that it ’ s shaping our world in ways that we may not necessarily see . </s>  these changes in technology are influencing our behavior in ways that we may not necessarily be aware of . </s>  so the idea is to just make that matrix visible to people . </s>  sign up here to get the on tech newsletter in your inbox every weekday . </s>    this briefing has ended . </s>  read global live updates on

benefits of reopening society . </s>  the coronavirus pandemic continued its global assault on saturday , with more than 1.7 million known cases recorded worldwide and at least 107,000 deaths . </s>  but even as some countries join the list of those with broad lockdown orders and others maintain or extend sweeping shutdowns , others have begun eyeing the benefits of reopening at least some parts of society . </s>  in iran , the hardest-hit country so far in its region , some government offices and shops , factories and other businesses began reopening on saturday as the national lockdown is lifted in phases . </s>  president hassan rouhani had said last week that economic and government activity must continue . </s>  on saturday , he said that people should still observe social distancing . </s>  the lifting of restrictions came despite warnings from the country ’ s health ministry that the reopening could cause a new spike in cases and tens of thousands of additional deaths . </s>  some of the most grievously hit countries in europe , while still recording hundreds of new deaths every day , say that the worst appears to be past . </s>  their plans to ease some

reported a falling death rate and a daily growth in new cases of about 3 percent , compared with 20 percent in mid-march . </s>  but officials stressed the limits of that easing . </s>  “ spain continues in a state of lockdown , ” health minister salvador illa warned on friday . </s>  “ we are not yet in a de-escalation phase. ” italy , which follows spain in cases but has the highest death

and schools starting next week , norway will allow pupils to attend kindergarten . </s>  and china has ended its lockdown of wuhan , where the coronavirus first emerged . </s>  for many countries , the question of whether to ease restrictions does not have a clear answer yet . </s>  in the united states , president trump — and governors of each state — are balancing calls from medical experts to keep restrictions in place with pleas from bankers , corporate executives and industrialists to ease them . </s>  india , on the other hand , appears set to extend a 21-day lockdown for all 1.3 billion citizens for two more weeks , carrying it to the end of april . </s>  during a meeting with top officials , mr. modi said the lockdown had helped blunt the outbreak but that “ constant vigilance is paramount , ” according to a statement from his office . </s>  some countries put in place new measures . </s>  turkey on friday ordered a two-day curfew for 31 provinces . </s>  and

official verifications of their mandatory quarantine plans and checks of their temperatures . </s>  a times examination reveals the extent of president trump ’ s slow response to the virus , which has now claimed more than 20,000 lives in the u.s . </s>  throughout january , as president trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues , an array of figures inside his government — from top white house advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies — identified the threat , sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action . </s>  dozens of interviews and a review of emails and other records by the new york times revealed many previously unreported details of the roots and extent of mr. trump ’ s halting response . </s>  read the full investigation . </s>  the country now has more than 515,000 confirmed cases , by far the world ’ s largest count , and more than 20,000 deaths , surpassing italy

the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus with 20,109 . </s>  government projections obtained by the new york times found that without any mitigation , the death toll from the virus

remain closed for the rest of the academic year . </s>  read the latest updates for the new york region . </s>  citing the virus , the trump administration announced that it would issue visa penalties on countries that refuse to accept people the u.s. aims to deport . </s>  with so many restaurants and schools closed and other sources of demand disrupted , many of the largest farms in the country are being forced to destroy tens of millions of pounds of fresh food that they haven ’ t been able to sell or donate to food banks , which can only absorb so much perishable food . </s>  as coronavirus cases rise in latin america , murder rates fall . </s>  as countries contend with escalating body counts from the pandemic , some are experiencing an unanticipated decline in a different form of death : murder . </s>  lockdowns have reduced opportunities for homicides and other crimes , and the virus has taken some criminals out of action as they hunker down in their homes . </s>  some gangs have even led efforts to impose curfews in neighborhoods where they hold sway . </s>  the drop in murders is especially notable in latin america , the region with the highest homicide rates in the world outside of war . </s>  in el salvador , for example , there were just 65 homicides in march , down from 114 in february . </s>  neighboring honduras has also seen a falloff in killings in

ordered that no more n95 respirators , ventilators , hospital gowns and other key medical supplies be exported until customs officials perform quality inspections on each shipment . </s>  the new policy , announced by china ’ s general administration of customs on friday , produced immediate delays to cargos on saturday as manufacturers , freight agents and traders tried to understand how to comply . </s>  china is the world ’ s dominant producer of a wide range of medical supplies , and its manufacturing lead has widened in many sectors as it has engaged in a nationwide mobilization of medical supplies production since late january . </s>  the chinese customs agency said that it had previously checked whether medical supplies were accurately counted , whether they infringed foreign patents and other intellectual property , and whether they had fraudulent documents . </s>  but now the agency will also assess the quality of goods . </s>  the agency gave no indication of how long the quality testing might take . </s>  the policy comes after a series of complaints from europe that medical supplies from china had problems . </s>  chinese officials have countered that many of these supplies were industrial respirators that were not designed to meet medical standards and should not be expected to do so . </s>  the new rules cover china ’ s exports in 11 categories : medical respirators and surgical masks , medical protective clothing , infrared thermometers , ventilators , surgical caps , medical goggles , medical gloves , medical shoe covers , patient monitors , medical disinfection towels and medical disinfectants . </s>  montreal police open a criminal investigation into deaths at a nursing home . </s>  the police in montreal said on saturday night that they had launched a criminal investigation into a private residence for the elderly after 31 people had died there since march 13 , at least five of them from confirmed cases of covid-19 . </s>  quebec ’ s premier , françois legault , said that the government had learned of the deaths at the 150-bed résidence herron , in a suburb west of montreal , on friday , and that he believed they amounted to “ gross negligence. ” “ this is terrible what happened , ” mr. legault said on saturday , adding that when officials from the regional health authority had arrived at the residence on march 29 to investigate , “ almost all the staff was gone. ” at that point , he said , the authority dispatched a team of health workers to care for the residents , and it has now taken over the running of the

the 53 employees of the wien energie company have been holed up in four power plants since march 20 , after volunteering to go into their own version of a lockdown until april 16 . </s>  depending on how things go , they could be asked to stay on longer . </s>  the workers miss their families , but shrug off the idea that they are making a big sacrifice , pointing out that doctors , nurses and other health workers had it much tougher . </s>  “ we are just a cog in a much bigger wheel , ” said steven sacher , 24 , an engineer at the flötzersteig plant . </s>  wien energie turned conference rooms into dormitories , and outfitted the plants with washing machines , fitness equipment , wireless internet — and , crucially , board games and jigsaw puzzles . </s>  “ we have finished about 20

people since world war ii , mr. johnson is still leaving a bit of breathing room . </s>  the prime minister said people also could leave their houses for exercise , either alone or with family members , and he did not close parks in london , which became a symbol of britain ’ s nonchalant response this weekend when they were thronged with people . </s>  nor is britain requiring that people who leave the houses carry documents , as france now does . </s>  mr. johnson did not detail what fines those who did not comply with the rules would face . </s>  still , as the wail of ambulance sirens

chief scientific and medical advisers — there has been little follow-up from the government about what kinds of social distancing rules people should adopt and what the risks of failing to do so are .

produce a coherent information campaign to clarify how people should observe the new social distancing rules . </s>  britain has a legacy of producing effective advertising campaigns during health crises . </s>  in the 1980s , under prime minister margaret thatcher , the government aired commercials about the risks of transmitting aids that , while unpopular at the time , were credited with raising public awareness about the disease . </s>  the absence of a coronavirus campaign was more glaring given that other public service advertising has continued , some of it striking a discordant note . </s>  on one major tv channel sunday , mr. johnson ’ s daily news briefing on coronavirus was followed by a government ad recruiting health workers to the national health service . </s>  it featured the slogan “ there ’ s never been a better time to join us. ” the prime minister ’ s prior reluctance to take restrictive measures , analysts said , is rooted in both his own libertarian

tilman j. fertitta pleaded with president trump to let his chains of high-end eateries gain access to a government loan program meant for small businesses . </s>  mr. fertitta , the billionaire owner of the restaurant group landry ’ s , told mr. trump it was unfair that he had to lay off 40,000 workers at his 600 restaurants only because they were employed by a larger corporation that was suddenly boxed out of the program amid public outrage over big companies getting bailouts . </s>  mr. trump turned to treasury secretary steven mnuchin , whose rule changes had excluded companies like landry ’

through the program as indicative of corporate cronyism . </s>  last week , the democratic national committee and democratic state parties in swing states held conference calls with reporters and

on an ad featuring small-business owners and employees describing jobs and businesses that were “ rescued ” by mr. mcconnell ’ s efforts on the stimulus package . </s>  but left-leaning groups have seized on the program ’ s stumbles and are spending heavily to get that message to voters . </s>  priorities usa , one of the largest super pacs on the democratic side , has been paying facebook to

voters know who is to blame for this economic crisis , ” said tara mcgowan , the chief executive and founder of pacronym . </s>  democrats and allied groups have been buoyed by polling from navigator research , which is overseen by leaders of several progressive organizations , that found a majority of americans were “ very concerned ” that the loans were going to large corporations and businesses like the los angeles lakers instead of small businesses . </s>  the issue is already coming up on the virtual campaign trail . </s>  mr. biden has been raising mr. trump ’ s management of the stimulus money with growing frequency in television interviews and on social media . </s>  this month , mr. biden vowed that , if elected , he would appoint a new inspector general to investigate where the stimulus money went and refer any misdeeds or “ corrupt giveaways ” to the justice department for prosecution . </s>  the paycheck protection program , which provides forgivable loans to cover eight weeks of payroll and overhead costs to businesses with 500 or fewer employees , has benefited many small companies . </s>  more than four million loans have been approved and , according to the federal reserve ’ s most recent “ beige book ” report , the program has helped limit layoffs . </s>  but the rollout has not gone smoothly , with technical glitches and delays hampering efforts to

the money . </s>  it remains unclear whether the program will be replenished when it runs out of funds for a second time , but it will most likely continue to put mr. trump and republicans on the defensive . </s>  stephen moore , the conservative economist who is an informal adviser to mr. trump , said that republicans made a mistake in devising a program with insufficient transparency in which most of the loans turn into grants . </s>  that has given big companies an incentive to seek free money . </s>  “ that was a very foolish and expensive decision that has led to a lot of taxpayer rip-offs , ” mr. moore said . </s>    mumbai , india — the spreading coronavirus may soon affect people ’ s health in a different way : the outbreak is now starting to hurt the supply of essential

coronavirus . </s>  now , even as some of the country ’ s factories have restarted , shortages of some drugs may develop . </s>  the disruption is being felt most acutely in india , where the authorities on tuesday ordered the country ’ s vast pharmaceutical industry to stop exporting 26 drugs and drug ingredients , most of them antibiotics , without explicit government permission . </s>  that ’ s a problem for the rest of the world , which relies on india ’ s drug makers for much of its supply of generic drugs . </s>  india exported about $ 19 billion of drugs last year and accounted for about one-fifth of the world ’ s exports of generics by volume , according to the india brand equity foundation . </s>  the shortage of chinese drug ingredients is the latest example of the global economy ’ s dependence on products made in china , from iphones to auto parts . </s>  last month , apple cut its sales expectations , partly because production of its gadgets was ramping up more slowly than expected as china reopened its factories . </s>  much of the fallout may still be hidden and is likely to play out over months . </s>  india ’ s decision to limit drug exports was particularly delicate since other countries rely on its manufacturers . </s>  on tuesday , one indian official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue , said the government wanted to ensure an adequate supply of medicines for indians before allowing exports . </s>  last week , the food and drug administration warned that one undisclosed drug was already in

morning . </s>  “ we ’ re working very closely to look at that list to assess how that will affect the medical supply chain , ” he said . </s>  lawmakers and trump administration officials have been eyeing the global supply chains that deliver drugs and other medical supplies to the united states , wary that the coronavirus might lead to shortages of key supplies . </s>  in a hearing in july , experts told the united states-china economic and security review commission that america had a troubling reliance on china for its drug supply — but that purchasing from india instead would also have its downsides . </s>  rosemary gibson , a co-author of “ china rx : exposing the risks of america ’ s dependence on china for medicine , ” who testified at that hearing , said india also imported the

chinese drug ingredients and concluded last week that 34 drugs had no alternative suppliers , according to a report on tuesday in the economic times , a major indian newspaper . </s>  indian drug makers depend on chinese factories for important ingredients , particularly for antibiotics and vitamins . </s>  although indian companies had stockpiled extra ingredients ahead of the lunar new year holiday , those reserves are now running low . </s>  krishnanath munde , who follows the pharmaceutical industry for india ratings and research , a unit of fitch group , said that for now indian

in china and around the globe , we expect a disruption of the supply chains , ” he said . </s>  “ then everyone will be hit — every sector. ” mr. jain said that larger manufacturers had ingredient stocks to last until may for most drugs , but some products could be affected earlier . </s>  india ’ s scores of small manufacturers are already struggling to cope with rising prices for some

remaining options : closing workplaces , restricting people to their homes and cordoning off targeted areas to help control the spread of infection . </s>  the possibility of more draconian measures if the outbreak continues to escalate has become a rising subject of conversation among public health officials across the country , forcing them to confront difficult questions about how much pain to

are some of the most significant governmental interventions in the history of our country. ” with new research estimating that 400 people in the seattle area could die in the coming weeks if officials are unable to alter the trajectory of the outbreak , state and city leaders in washington state have already begun evaluating whether some of those more extreme restrictions could become necessary . </s>  kevin wickersham , the incident commander at washington ’ s department of health , said that none of the options were off the table , but that officials were mindful of the tremendous burden such restrictions could impose on families and businesses . </s>  “ we want to do everything possible to keep society functioning as much as it possibly can , ” mr. wickersham said . </s>  china took a series of relatively extreme measures to contain the initial outbreak of the coronavirus , including sealing off cities , preventing travel and requiring people to stay in their homes . </s>  thanks in large part to those measures , the country has seen a drastic drop in the number of new cases . </s>  “ we wouldn ’ t go nearly as close as china in terms of making those kinds of impositions on

that his order had limited legal power and that he did not believe it was necessary to impose forced shutdowns . </s>  at the federal level , president trump has declared a national emergency and imposed new travel restrictions from europe . </s>  he also said that some domestic restrictions , such as limiting travel to hot spots like washington state or california , might be necessary . </s>  mr. wickersham said orders to close businesses in washington would be considered only if the virus transmission data showed that such an escalation was necessary . </s>  restricting people to their homes , he said , could be done in a limited way , but not so that it disrupted their ability to get food , medicine or medical treatment . </s>  he said local jurisdictions might consider limiting the entry of people into certain regions , but probably only in small areas , perhaps to protect an area with a population that is particularly vulnerable to the disease . </s>  washington state ’ s decisions so far , which have offered an early window into what may be coming for other states as the virus expands its range in the united states , have been guided by researchers ’ emphasis on the benefits of limiting social contact . </s>  in a report made public this week , researchers at the institute for disease modeling , the bill & melinda gates foundation and the fred hutchinson cancer research center concluded that under the current trajectory of the virus , some 25,000 people in the seattle area could be infected in the next four weeks , and 400 of those might die . </s>  the researchers said that if policymakers could reduce the transmission rate by 75 percent — primarily through social distancing — then only a fraction of those illnesses might manifest and only 30 more people would be projected to die . </s>  ms. durkan said those projections helped shape the decisions that were made this week . </s>  city leaders announced on thursday evening the closing of all libraries and community centers , while gov . </s>  jay inslee ordered the shuttering of schools in the state for six weeks . </s>  earlier in the week , the governor ordered a ban on all public gatherings of more than 250 people . </s>  ms. durkan said she was hopeful that the so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions pursued thus far would be enough to substantially alter the trajectory of

a certain way carries its own stigma . </s>  “ our brains are just designed to experience a lot of excruciating pain at the idea of being alone , ” ms. ocasio-cortez said . </s>  “ when you cast those lonely votes , you feel like your colleagues respect you less , and that you are choosing to marginalize yourself. ” it can be difficult to appreciate the “ powerful psychology of the house floor , ”

paxton ’ s move outraged democrats and civil rights groups in texas , who said it was part of a long line of actions by republicans to make it harder for minority and low-income voters , who tend to vote democratic , to cast ballots . </s>  “ it appears the priorities of conservative state leaders are clear : suppress the vote at all costs , even if it puts lives at risk , ” ed espinoza , executive director of progress texas , said in a statement . </s>  mr. paxton ’ s filing came as the state faces several lawsuits over its mail-in ballot rules , and as he has heightened tensions with three of the state ’ s largest democratic-led cities . </s>  earlier , mr. paxton warned officials in austin , dallas and san antonio that their local mask-wearing requirements and other restrictions

’ s blunt assessment was the clearest signal yet that the trillions of dollars in support that policymakers had already funneled into the economy might not be enough to prevent lasting damage from a pandemic that has shuttered businesses and thrown more than 20 million people out of work . </s>  it was also a rejoinder to lawmakers and the trump administration , whose discussions of additional rescue measures have run aground as democrats unveil a wish list and republicans shy away from more federal spending , betting instead that reopening the economy will quickly and significantly lift growth . </s>  “ the recovery may take some time to gather momentum , ” mr. powell said at a peterson institute for international economics virtual event , where he lauded congress ’ s early response packages and suggested that an uncertain outlook might call for more . </s>  “ additional fiscal support could be costly , but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a

found that over the five years before the coronavirus pandemic — january 2015 to mid-february 2020 — 19 children with kawasaki disease were treated at hospital papa giovanni xxiii in bergamo province , which has an advanced pediatric department . </s>  but between feb. 18 and april 20 alone , the hospital , located at the epicenter of italy ’ s coronavirus outbreak , treated 10 children with similar hyperinflammatory symptoms . </s>  eight of them tested positive for coronavirus antibodies . </s>  ten cases in two months — about 30 times the rate of the kawasaki disease cases , which

the shift in policy came after two aides working near the president — a military valet and katie miller , the vice president ’ s press secretary — tested positive for the virus last week . </s>  mr.

ago , when coal was so dominant that it provided nearly half the nation ’ s electricity . </s>  and it comes despite the trump administration ’ s three-year push to try to revive the ailing industry . </s>  those efforts , however , failed to halt the powerful economic forces that have led electric utilities to retire hundreds of aging coal plants since 2010 and run their remaining plants less frequently . </s>  as factories , retailers , restaurants and office buildings have shut down nationwide to slow the spread of the virus , demand for electricity has fallen sharply . </s>  and because coal plants often cost more to operate than gas plants or renewables , many utilities are cutting back on coal power first in response . </s>  hospitals try a low-tech way to help some patients :

observers of russian disinformation tactics in electoral interference have two big questions as the 2020 election approaches : how large is the appetite for escalation among russian intelligence agencies this time around ? </s>  and where was , and is , s.v.r. , russia ’ s counterpart to the c.i.a . ? </s>  the internal competition between russian spy agencies is fierce , and s.v.r. , a potent and storied foreign intelligence agency , is widely recognized as more competent , and stealthier , than russia ’ s bumbling military spy agency , g.r.u . </s>  it was g.r.u . </s>  that was caught red-handed in 2016 meddling in the presidential election . </s>  at stake is what kind of election interference we should expect as november is coming : a lackluster rerun of leaking and trolling and fake social media activity , which would most likely be harder to do and less effective than in 2016 — or more pernicious operational innovation and escalation , perhaps even tactics that take advantage of the coronavirus outbreak . </s>  american intelligence officials reportedly reached a preliminary conclusion last week , and that answer points to escalation — as well as to s.v.r . </s>  russian intelligence operatives , according to reports on the united states intelligence assessment , are working to support and amplify white supremacist groups in order to try to incite violence . </s>  the goal of an aggressive foreign active measures campaign is not , as a recently departed senior intelligence official implied , to strengthen president trump . </s>  it is to weaken the united states . </s>  so what can we expect ? </s>  the history of russian foreign intelligence provides some clues . </s>  the s.v.r. , situated like its american counterpart in a forest outside the capital , inherited from the k.g.b . </s>  a large and skilled unit in charge of disinformation , service a . </s>  the “ a ” stood for active measures , as disinformation was renamed in the early 1960s . </s>  only now is it becoming possible to reconstruct some of service a ’ s most brazen operations , with the help of k.g.b . </s>  memos and briefings discovered in recent years in security archives in former satellite states . </s>  racial engineering is an old but sharp tool in the active measures arsenal , deployed equally against — and among — african-americans , jews and white nationalists , to pitch these groups against one other and to amplify social conflict . </s>  on christmas night 1959 , for example , swastikas and “ jews out ” was daubed , in red and white paint , on the walls of the newly reopened synagogue in cologne , germany . </s>  over the next seven weeks a vast anti-semitic hate campaign swept through west germany , other countries in western europe and the united states . </s>  by mid-february , the government in bonn had counted 833 anti-semitic incidents across all west germany . </s>  k.g.b . </s>  officers understood that anti-semitism was a real problem and that they could restart a real fire with fake sparks . </s>  at one jewish cemetery in staten island , n.y. , 100 headstones were defaced with swastikas , smeared in yellow paint . </s>  on jan. 4 , 1960 , three synagogues in new york city were desecrated within 24 hours . </s>  red swastikas , six feet high , were painted on the free synagogue of flushing , queens . </s>  the corona jewish center , also in queens , and temple emanu-el , at fifth avenue and 65th street in manhattan , were similarly defaced . </s>  in the following days more acts of vandalism were reported , including at a yeshiva in brooklyn . </s>  at least 13 cities across the united states were affected , including washington , detroit , cincinnati and chicago . </s>  less than a year later , another insidious example of racial engineering appeared , this time in africa . </s>  the 15-page pamphlet started with a one-line , all-caps cover page , inscribed “ to our dear friends. ” the document purported to come from the “ african friends association , ” allegedly based in the united states . </s>  “ we , negroes living in the united states of america , are going to reveal the truth to you about the way the americans really treat people with dark skin , ” the pamphlet said . </s>  the forgers reported , for example — truthfully — that edward aaron , 34 , had been abducted , beaten and castrated by klansmen in birmingham , ala . </s>  the k.g.b . </s>  circulated and published its paper in english and french in at least 16 african countries . </s>  “ this poisonous little racist tract is a headache for our diplomatic missions in africa , ” richard helms of the c.i.a . </s>  told the senate judiciary committee in june 1961 — a particular headache because the k.g.b . </s>  largely stuck to the facts . </s>  active measures are not necessarily limited to pamphleteering and subversive media work . </s>  in 1957 , czechoslovak intelligence agents executed a brazen terrorist attack against the prefect in strasbourg , france , under the false cover of a german neo-nazi group that did not exist . </s>  operatives from prague infiltrated into paris , and mailed a bomb camouflaged as a box of cigars to the prefect , in an attempt to kill him and his guests at a high-profile dinner party , to drive a wedge between the governments in paris and bonn . </s>  but the parcel missed its target and killed the prefect ’ s wife , henriette trémeaud . </s>  so how is this forgotten history of disinformation linked to today , and to the coronavirus outbreak ? </s>  disinformation is about activating emotional reactions , in order to divide and corrode the targeted entity — a focus on true or false is misleading ; a measure becomes active if it resonates with emotions . </s>  corrosion works best if it exploits existing fissures and cracks , or “ contradictions , ” that can be “ deepened ” or “ sharpened , ” in the jargon of active measures planners . </s>  anti-semitism and brittle race-relations are examples of such unresolved contradictions — just last week facebook and twitter took down a new russian influence campaign that targeted african-american voters in the lead-up to november , via a front group in africa . </s>  another example is the fear and the rumors that surround a pandemic , especially when it is badly managed and highly politicized . </s>  service a systematically embraced infectious diseases in the last decade of the cold war . </s>  in the early and mid-1980s the k.g.b. ’ s disinformation shop repeatedly blamed the c.i.a . </s>  for spreading dengue fever in cuba , as well as malaria in pakistan ( the operation was code-named tarakany , “ cockroaches ” in russian ) . </s>  the officer in charge of tarakany later received an award from the k.g.b . </s>  chairman . </s>  the best-known and most successful infectious disease measure is the k.g.b. ’ s persistent campaign to portray aids as a biological weapon designed by the united states army at fort detrick , md. , a campaign code-named denver . </s>  the covid-19 pandemic in the united states has three features beyond fear that make it highly attractive raw material for disinformation : the coronavirus is sweeping right into campaign season , it is already flanked by polarizing conspiracy theories and the president ’ s response to the emergency is hotly contested . </s>  the virus is exposing a range of contradictions ready for sharpening — for example , a simmering generational conflict spurred by skewed fatality rates . </s>  to reach their disruptive goal , russian planners may well calculate , as they did in 2016 , that helping mr. trump weakens america . </s>  thomas rid , a professor at johns hopkins university , is the author of the

fluorescent lights overhead and the disposable cups of industrial-grade coffee in our hands . </s>  in a video playing at the front of the room , a pleasant voice explained how to identify a person experiencing homelessness : you simply remember , “ a , b , c , ” for appearance ( layered clothing and disheveled hair , for instance ) , behavior ( sleeping on the ground ) , and condition ( refers to a vehicle , perhaps with its windows covered ) . </s>  around me , dozens of volunteers listened , just closely enough to get the idea . </s>  it was thursday night , in the basement of echo park united methodist church , and we were waiting to go out , clipboards in hand , to help perform the annual count of los angeles ’ s homeless population . </s>  last week , similar point-in-time counts of homeless populations took place around the state . </s>  like the census , the counts are federally mandated and imperfect , and the results help determine how and where money flows . </s>  gov . </s>  gavin newsom participated in the count in san diego , where he lauded volunteers for “ stepping up and being part of the solution. ” this year , the counts took place against the backdrop of a housing emergency that has reshaped life across the golden state and dominated the attention of policymakers at every level . </s>  in the echo park neighborhood of l.a. , near where i live , tensions had been rising over an encampment in a grassy clearing on the northern edge of echo park lake . </s>  though city officials have said the area needs to be cleaned , residents and activists have said unpredictable sweeps and citations are really meant to push the unhoused out of a public space . </s>  some of the volunteers said they were planning to join residents of the encampment in a protest the next morning . </s>  the count , they said , was an important way of ensuring officials confront the full scope of homelessness in their communities . </s>  more broadly , volunteers told me it was the magnitude of the crisis they saw every day that moved them to spend four hours of their evenings looking for people sleeping in alleys or doorways and counting tents . </s>  ceraun loggins , 29 , told me they moved from washington , d.c. , in april . </s>  they bike to work , and seeing the number of people living on the streets , they said , “ was a punch to the gut. ” joining the count seemed like a simple way to help . </s>  “ it ’ s like one of these invisible mechanisms , ” they said . </s>  “ you don ’ t think about how it has to happen. ” after the short video , there was a mildly chaotic shuffle as the volunteers broke into groups of two to four . </s>  each team was assigned a census tract . </s>  some were walkable . </s>  some , tucked higher into the hills , required a car . </s>  the los angeles homeless services authority gathers more specific demographic information about who is experiencing homelessness in a separate survey . </s>  this time , though , we were told to count visually — not to engage . </s>  i tagged along with a group of four , all in our 20s or 30s . </s>  we walked to our narrow rectangle tract , which was lined by quiet apartment buildings set back above the street . </s>  we saw a woman rifle through a trash can before continuing down the sidewalk . </s>  she nodded at us and said something quietly as she passed . </s>  we nodded back but didn ’ t ask where she was headed . </s>  a member of our group , chloe english , 29 , made a mark on the form . </s>  “ well , we got a grand total of one , ” she said at the end of our route . </s>  she paused . </s>  “ it ’ s a nice thing we only encountered one. ” of course , in another tract , that most likely would have been different . </s>  still , i was struck by how the task felt mundane , and enormous at the same time : there aren ’ t people living in their cars or sleeping outside on every block in l.a. county . </s>  but someone has to check every block to know . </s>  on sunday morning , i visited the encampment by the lake at the center of the protest . </s>  residents sat outside their tents and chatted . </s>  i asked jasmine martinez , a

president trump last held a news briefing , with a promise to the sparse group of journalists allowed in the room under the current social distancing guidelines . </s>  “ i will never lie to you , you have my word on that , ” she said . </s>  ms. mcenany , the president ’ s fourth press secretary , found that vow almost immediately tested . </s>  discussing the sexual harassment accusation by a former staff member against joseph r. biden jr. , the president ’ s likely general election opponent , she said the president had “ always told the truth on these issues , ” ignoring mr. trump ’ s evasions and misrepresentations in responding to dozens of accusations against him . </s>  she claimed it was unfair to bring up issues from “ four years ago that were asked and answered. ” in reality , a new accusation of rape was raised against the president as recently as last year . </s>  in a reference to the special counsel robert s. mueller iii , she claimed that his investigation of mr. trump ended with “ $ 40 million of taxpayer money being lost in the complete and total exoneration of president trump. ” in fact , the cost of the report was about $ 32 million , according to the justice department , and its conclusion was not a “ total exoneration ” of the president . </s>  she defended michael t. flynn , the former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the f.b.i. , whom the president is trying to rehabilitate , by misquoting and mischaracterizing newly released notes showing the way f.b.i . </s>  officials debated how to deal with mr. flynn and figure out the goals of an interview . </s>  ms. mcenany claimed one of the notes said , “ quote , ‘ we need to get flynn to lie , ’ quote , and ‘ get him fired. ’ ” in fact , the note said , “ what ’ s our goal ? </s>  truth/admission or to get him to lie , so we can prosecute him or get him fired ? ” and she came prepared with a notebook full of talking points , referring to it as she reiterated mr. trump ’ s blame-defecting attacks on china and the world health organization for allegedly contributing to the worldwide spread of the coronavirus . </s>  over all , ms. mcenany ’ s confident performance was less combative than those of one of her predecessors , sarah huckabee sanders . </s>  and her first go-round , while delivering its own share of falsehoods , did not create the same kind of disastrous first impression that sean spicer , the president ’ s first white house press secretary , did when he claimed , falsely , that mr. trump ’ s inauguration crowd was the “ largest audience to ever witness an inauguration , period , both in person and around the globe. ” it also made her more accessible than her immediate predecessor , stephanie grisham , who finished her brief tenure never having once briefed the news media . </s>  by ms. mcenany ’ s own definition of what she said she was there to do for the president , she was a success . </s>  “ i ’ m consistently with him absorbing his thinking , and it is my mission to bring you the mind-set of the president , deliver those facts , ” ms. mcenany said . </s>  ms. mcenany , a harvard law school graduate whose last job was working as a spokeswoman for the trump campaign , pitched herself as part of a new guard in the west wing . </s>  she said she — along with alyssa farah , the communications director , and ben williamson , another communications adviser who joined the white house as part of a reorganization instituted by mark meadows , the new chief of staff — is committed to fostering a new era of transparency with the news media . </s>  but that is a lofty goal three and a half years into the trump presidency , as mr. trump has made it clear that the job of communicating for him is almost impossible , and that trying to undermine the credibility of the news media is central to his re-election efforts . </s>  ms. mcenany ’ s posture toward the news media on friday was friendlier than she has been so far in the job . </s>  “ leave it to the media to irresponsibly take president trump out of context and run with negative headlines , ” ms. mcenany said last week , after mr. trump suggested that disinfectants could potentially combat the coronavirus . </s>  on twitter , she harangued a reporter who referred to mr. trump online simply by his last name . </s>  “ to you , he ’ s not trump , he ’ s president trump ! ” ms. mcenany tweeted last month . </s>  before her briefing debut , ms. mcenany spent days preparing , participating in murder board sessions with other members of the press and communications staff , and receiving briefings from economic experts and doctors , officials said . </s>  but administration officials said ms. mcenany was not expected to hold a daily press briefing , and will conduct briefings interspersed with mr. trump ’ s own sessions with reporters . </s>  the president in recent weeks has complained to aides that he “ wants his people out there ” more defending himself and his administration ’ s response to the coronavirus , and the attempt to resuscitate the briefing , officials said , was partly a reaction to that wish . </s>  a bipartisan group of former white house press secretaries , foreign service and military officials this year signed an open letter advocating the return of the daily briefing — titled , “ why america needs to hear from its government , ” and arguing that “ the public has a right to know what its government is doing , and the government has a duty to explain what it is doing. ” but critics said there was a marked difference between holding a daily press briefing and doing it on days when you think it will be to your advantage . </s>  “ if there was ever a real news situation , and we didn ’ t brief , that would have been significant , ” said dan pfeiffer , a former communications director under president barack obama . </s>  “ when you get to pick the days you brief , it ’ s not the same thing. ” mr. pfeiffer , who had his own problems with reporters , said despite the subdued tone of ms. mcenany ’ s first outing with the news media , he was no longer willing to give the trump administration the benefit of the doubt , given its long track record of dealing in falsehoods . </s>  “ the trump white house is not putting the briefing back on in order to inform the public , ” he said . </s>  “ they ’ re doing it to create a gladiator style show where the new press secretary will bash the press and trump will fire up his base . ” </s>    the new york times would like to hear

explain in my latest column , the idea for a multitrillion-dollar “ bridge loan ” for everyone — rather than industry-specific bailouts — seems like the cleanest way to keep companies in business . </s>  what could everyone support ? </s>  the politics of the 2008 bailouts were so ugly that i was searching for something that could win over democrats and republicans . </s>  the response to this column has been encouraging : several political leaders ’ staff members asked me how the loans would work , and executives reached out to say they wanted to push the idea in washington . </s>  the nyt reports that there is a proposal already making the rounds in policymaking circles , devised by the economists glenn hubbard and michael strain , that would forgive emergency bank loans to small

house budget director under president barack obama and is now at lazard . </s>  he suggested : “ why not have the government immediately re-inject funds into the banks who extend the loans and then do repayment from the company directly through the tax code ? </s>  the company would only be allowed to deduct x percent of non-labor expenses ( where x is less than 100 and could be scaled based on the state of the economy ) until the debt is repaid . </s>  that repayment approach provides a form of auto-stabilizer — since the repayments will be accelerated if the economy starts booming and delayed

powers over hong kong could inflict even more damage on already fraught relations between washington and beijing , and force president trump into uncomfortable decisions about whether to maintain his self-described friendly ties with the chinese president , xi jinping . </s>  the proposal announced in beijing on thursday provoked outrage in congress , where bipartisan support grew quickly for new sanctions on chinese officials and entities that mr. trump — who has shown limited interest in hong kong ’ s plight and a continued desire to carry out terms of a trade deal with beijing — may not welcome . </s>  giving the government broad new powers to crack down on pro-democracy activists could effectively end hong kong ’ s limited independence and crush a protest movement that has agitated for nearly a year against china ’ s authoritarian communist party . </s>  “ this move by beijing would rip away the remaining veneer of ‘ one country , two systems. ’ it would precipitate a crisis in u.s.-china relations , ” said evan medeiros , a senior asia director at the national security council under president barack obama and a professor at georgetown university . </s>  “ nationalist voices in the u.s. and china would have a party with this ; 2020 is beginning to feel more and more like 1948 when the first crises of the cold war broke out over berlin , ” mr. medeiros said , predicting

he did not know “ what it is , ” but added , “ if it happens , we ’ ll address that issue very strongly. ” the white house otherwise had no comment . </s>  when mass demonstrations against beijing took place in hong kong last summer , mr. trump — who has shown little interest in issues of democracy and human rights generally — had a muted response despite bipartisan pressure to show more support for a protest movement with open sympathies for the united states . </s>  and even as he has lashed out at china ’ s government for its handling of the winter coronavirus outbreak in wuhan , helping to prompt the sharpest downturn in relations with beijing in decades , mr. trump has taken care not to insult or offend mr. xi . </s>  because of the pandemic ’ s economic toll , china has yet to meet purchasing demands outlined in a january trade agreement between the two nations . </s>  mr. trump and his economic advisers would like to see the deal fulfilled to aid his re-election

trump ’ s democratic opponent , former vice president joseph r. biden jr. , as too conciliatory toward beijing . </s>  mr. trump has repeatedly muddied that message with his deferential tone toward mr. xi . </s>  “ any effort to impose national security legislation that does not reflect the will of the people of hong kong would be highly destabilizing , and would be met with strong condemnation

significant autonomy until 2047 . </s>  “ the communist regime in beijing would like nothing more than to extinguish the autonomy of hong kong and the rights of its people , ” mr. toomey said in a

negotiations with china in 2018 and 2019 , the economy-centric view seemed to prevail and helped to explain mr. trump ’ s repeated fulsome praise of mr. xi as a “ brilliant leader ” and a “ great man. ” but the emergence of the coronavirus from wuhan , and the chinese government ’ s initial efforts to conceal it , enraged mr. trump , who saw his re-election imperiled as a result , and in recent weeks the hawkish camp has pressed the sinister theory , with no evidence , that the virus escaped from a chinese lab . </s>  on wednesday , the national security council released a white house strategy document detailing a “ competitive ” american approach devised in part to “ to compel beijing to cease or reduce actions harmful to the united states ’ vital , national interests and those of

passed legislation last fall , mr. trump was noncommittal about whether he would sign the measure . </s>  but he eventually did on the evening before thanksgiving , ensuring it gained minimal

over his black challenger — a move that has garnered some criticism . </s>  in a statement , bowman called the decision “ disappointing , ” and allies said it was proof that the black caucus cared

first time on sunday , and mr. sanders , who is staying in the democratic primary race despite a series of defeats , has already telegraphed his strategy . </s>  “ joe , what are you going to do ? ” mr. sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week , ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press mr. biden on , including health care , student debt , climate change , mass incarceration , immigration and wealth inequality . </s>  mr. biden , for his part , has criticized mr. sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal , “ medicare for all. ” here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise . </s>  health care biden one of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that mr. biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like “ medicare for all. ” instead , he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for — a proposal that still goes well beyond the affordable care act . </s>  he estimates his plan would cost $ 750 billion over a decade . </s>  mr. biden would also increase tax credits for people to buy insurance through the affordable care act marketplace . </s>  his plan doesn ’ t specifically address medical debt . </s>  sanders one of the bedrock principles of mr. sanders ’ s campaign is that health care is a human right , and he is the torchbearer for medicare for all . </s>  he estimates his plan would cost about $ 30 trillion over 10 years and would be paid for by new revenue of about $ 17.5 trillion , along with “ current federal , state and local government spending. ” he also wants to eliminate $ 81 billion in medical debt . </s>  coronavirus biden the new coronavirus has quickly become the most urgent problem facing the country , and mr. biden released a plan on thursday calling for free testing , “ the elimination of all cost barriers to preventive care and treatment for covid-19 , ” and emergency paid leave for affected workers . </s>  he also wants to restore a white house office that oversaw responses to global health crises — an office that the obama administration created and the trump administration eliminated — and direct the justice department to combat price gouging for medical supplies . </s>  sanders mr. sanders outlined his plan to address the coronavirus in a speech on thursday . </s>  he called for a national state of emergency ( which president trump subsequently declared ) , emergency funding for paid sick leave , an expansion of community health centers and a mandate that all medications related to coronavirus be sold at cost . </s>  student debt biden mr. biden wants to make two-year community colleges and “ other high-quality training programs ” debt-free , but would not cancel existing student debt the way mr. sanders is proposing . </s>  his plan would , however , forgive the remaining balance for people who paid 5 percent of their discretionary income ( with the first $ 25,000 exempt ) toward their loans for 20 years . </s>  sanders mr. sanders wants to make all public colleges and universities free , cancel all student loan debt — about $ 1.6 trillion owed by about 45 million americans — and cap student loan interest rates at 1.88 percent . </s>  he says he would pay for the debt cancellation with a tax on financial transactions like stock trades . </s>  climate change biden mr. biden ’ s $ 1.7 trillion climate plan calls for 100 percent carbon-free energy and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 . </s>  it would end fossil fuel subsidies and subsidize clean energy , but envisions a continued role for fossil fuels for some time : it would not ban fracking , for instance . </s>  mr. biden also supports federal funding for carbon capture and sequestration programs that could , in theory , eventually offset some emissions . </s>  sanders mr. sanders is a proponent of the green new deal , a sweeping resolution that calls for aggressive action to combat climate change , and has modeled his $ 16.3 trillion proposal on that plan . </s>  he calls for an immediate ban on fracking , for the electricity and transportation sectors to be carbon-free by 2030 , and for the united states to end the use of fossil fuels no later than 2050 . </s>  sign up for on politics to get the latest election and politics news and insights . </s>  sign up for our politics newsletter immigration biden mr. biden wants to undo the trump administration ’ s hard-line immigration policies , reinstate the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants . </s>  in contrast to mr. sanders , he would not decriminalize unauthorized border crossings , but he is calling for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and says he would deport only people who have committed a serious crime . </s>  sanders mr. sanders has called for a moratorium on deportations pending a review of the current immigration system . </s>  he also supports the reinstatement and expansion of the daca program , which protected from deportation people who were brought into the united states as children . </s>  in addition , he has backed the movement to abolish federal agencies like immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection . </s>  mass incarceration biden criminal justice is a fraught issue for mr. biden , who helped pass laws , like the 1994 crime bill , that produced mass incarceration to begin with . </s>  he has made a stark reversal on the issue during this campaign , calling for incentives for states to shift from incarceration to crime prevention , an end to mandatory minimum sentences and the death penalty , and decriminalizing marijuana . </s>  in contrast to mr. sanders , however , he does not want to legalize marijuana . </s>  sanders mr. sanders has promised to cut the national prison population in half and end mass incarceration . </s>  to do that , he wants to abolish the death penalty , three-strikes laws and mandatory minimum sentences , among other measures . </s>  gun control biden mr. biden supports an assault weapons ban , a voluntary buyback program and a ban on online gun sales , as well as a slew of proposals that are nearly universal among democratic candidates now , like background checks and red-flag laws . </s>  he is also calling for incentives for states to enact gun licensing programs . </s>  sanders mr. sanders , like mr. biden , supports an assault weapons ban , a voluntary buyback program and many other gun restrictions . </s>  but much like criminal justice for mr. biden , gun control is a difficult area for mr. sanders , politically speaking : earlier in his career , he voted against federal background checks and legal liability for gun manufacturers . </s>  abortion biden mr. biden has a long and complicated record on abortion . </s>  in the 1980s , he supported an attempt to let states overturn roe v. wade , and he supported the hyde amendment — which prevents medicaid from covering abortion in most circumstances — until just last year . </s>  today , however , he supports the same basic set of policies every major democrat in the race did , including legislation to codify roe v. wade , repeals of the hyde amendment and the global and domestic “ gag rules , ” and a pledge to nominate only supreme court justices who support abortion rights . </s>  sanders mr. sanders also supports legislation to codify roe v. wade , opposes the hyde amendment and the global and domestic gag rules , and has promised to nominate only supreme court justices who would uphold roe v. wade . </s>  homelessness biden mr. biden is proposing $ 640 billion over 10 years for affordable housing , as well as a “ bill of rights ” that would provide protections against eviction , foreclosure and predatory mortgages . </s>  he also wants to create tax credits for renters and first-time homeowners and expand the section 8 housing voucher program . </s>  sanders mr. sanders proposes spending $ 2.5 trillion to build about 10 million permanently affordable housing units . </s>  he also wants to implement a national rent control standard and spend $ 70 billion to repair public housing . </s>  money in politics biden mr. biden is calling for a constitutional amendment to make elections completely publicly funded , eliminating all private contributions — a significant step beyond what mr. sanders has proposed . </s>  in the shorter term , he wants to put new restrictions on super pacs and publicly finance major parties ’ national conventions . </s>  sanders like most democrats , mr. sanders wants to overturn citizens united — the supreme court decision that prevents the government from banning political spending by corporations in elections — and then pass a constitutional amendment that makes clear that money is not speech . </s>  he also wants to abolish super pacs and has called for a ban on corporate contributions to the democratic national convention . </s>  he has criticized mr. biden for accepting campaign contributions from billionaires . </s>  wealth inequality biden mr. biden wants to strengthen collective bargaining , hold corporate executives personally liable for anti-union efforts and enforce labor laws more strongly . </s>  he is also calling , like many democrats , for a $ 15 minimum wage , and for higher taxes on corporations and wealthy investors . </s>  sanders mr. sanders has suggested taxing the rich with a wealth tax and progressive estate tax while also enacting a federal jobs guarantee , doubling union membership and taking other steps to bolster the working and middle class . </s>  he also wants to break up big banks . </s>    good morning and welcome to on politics , a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by new york times journalists . </s>  sign up

cost more than $ 1.8 trillion . </s>  but first , senate republicans must overcome democratic objections to the ambitious bill ; they say it lacks sufficient protections for workers , unemployment aid and restrictions for bailed-out businesses . </s>  a test vote on the legislation — which would put four-figure cash payments into most american workers ’ hands and offer relief to businesses — failed in the senate on sunday , 47 to 47 . </s>  after spending weeks playing down the threat of the virus , president trump is now holding daily news conferences , trying to project leadership on what will inevitably be the defining issue of his presidency — particularly for voters in november . </s>  so far , his efforts appear to be working : an abc news/ipsos poll released on friday found that a majority of americans now approve of trump ’ s handling of the crisis , up 12 points from the week before . </s>  whether those positive marks will be dented by comments like the one he made on sunday mocking the news that senator mitt romney was self-quarantining — “ romney ’ s in isolation ? </s>  gee , that ’ s too bad ” — remains to be seen . </s>  “ our goal is to get relief to americans as quickly as possible so that families can get by and small businesses can keep workers on the payroll , ” trump told reporters on sunday , reading from prepared remarks . </s>  but then he went off script , predicting a swift economic turnaround and saying that “ a pent-up demand ” would spur economic growth . </s>  “ this will help our economy , ” he said of the rescue package , “ and you will see our economy skyrocket once this is over. ” joe biden received the endorsement of the american federation of teachers on sunday , adding insult to injury for bernie sanders , who has advocated on behalf of teachers ’ unions and against charter schools throughout his campaign . </s>  the a.f.t. ’ s endorsement comes now that the democratic nomination fight is nearly a foregone conclusion , just as it did in 2016 , when the union — which represents 1.7 million educators , health care workers and public employees — endorsed hillary clinton in july , just before the democratic national convention . </s>  photo of the day a medical official at the white house took the temperature of a member of the news media in the white house briefing room on sunday . </s>  the crisis raises new questions about civil liberties . </s>  trump ’ s instincts during the crisis are right in line with his instincts before the crisis . </s>  as he has moved from raising doubts about the coronavirus ’ s danger to publicly acknowledging its threat , he has , for instance , responded by increasing immigration restrictions and advancing tax cuts to revive the economy . </s>  sound familiar ? </s>  now , trump ’ s justice department is seeking to expand its powers to detain people without trial , according to a report over the weekend by politico . </s>  in a letter to congress , william barr , the attorney general , requested the ability to waive restrictions on a range of topics , including statutes of limitations , the granting of asylums and the process of court hearings , politico reported . </s>  ( such a request would be unlikely to get through the democrats , who control the house . ) </s>  responses to the coronavirus are sure to exacerbate problems of backlog in the judicial system , and the administration is pushing to allow justice department lawyers to request that judges put court proceedings on pause in times of emergency . </s>  but the move comes just as advocates of prison reform are calling for a very different solution : the temporary release of all prisoners being held before trial . </s>  in a statement on friday , alec karakatsanis , a lawyer who is a proponent of cash bail reform , argued that releasing the accused on their own recognizance could help lighten the load on jails at a time when incarcerated people were at an increased risk of infection . </s>  “ a global pandemic will send these facilities spiraling into an abyss of contagion , ” karakatsanis said . </s>  “ based on everything we ’ ve learned thus far , this virus will continue to spread in jails and prisons — and the consequences will be devastating. ” on politics is also available as a newsletter . </s>  sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox . </s>  is

polite inquiry about what sort of food will be served , and if accommodations can be made for her . </s>  it ’ s a skill , she says , that has come in handy as california eases its way out of the stay at home order that gov . </s>  gavin newsom put in place on march 19 , and families like hers begin navigating the uncharted landscape of post-covid-19 socializing . </s>  “ i ’ m used to asking for the things that i need , or just saying i ’ m a vegetarian . </s>  but a lot of people aren ’ t used to having a discussion about what their comfort levels are when they socialize , ” she said . </s>  as shelter-in-place restrictions are eased around the world , people are facing uncomfortable conversations with friends and family over how far they can loosen the rules and still stay safe from infection . </s>  but it can be difficult to broach these subjects . </s>  will your friends come to a birthday party , being held outdoors , and still wear masks and keep their distance from one another ? </s>  can you gather with your family without asking your sister whether she continues to be vigilant about masks and sanitizing ? </s>  also , before you start extending invitations , it might be helpful to learn how to interpret lame excuses and awkward silences . </s>  ms. goodman and her husband , adam goodman , 40 , are parents to micah , 7 , and silvia , 5 . </s>  the foursome has cautiously begun socializing with a handful of neighborhood families , but with caveats : they only meet outdoors , everyone wears masks when it ’ s not possible to stay six feet apart , and if there are drinks involved , it ’ s strictly b.y.o.b . </s>  they want to begin socializing more widely , but haven ’ t yet hammered out the phrasing they ’ ll use when discussing with friends how that might look . </s>  “ this is a new social landscape , ” she said . </s>  “ do you say , ‘ i ’ m a social distancer ’ ? </s>  is that how you indicate what your needs are ? </s>  we don ’ t have a language for describing it yet. ” for judith and akshat pujara , who are both 38 and parents to alice , 3 , this new tiptoeing around terminology for socializing also evokes a sense of déjà vu . </s>  “ i feel the same about this that i do about asking about guns in a home , ” said ms. pujara , a workplace strategist . </s>  “ i never thought i ’ d have to ask questions like this , but i do. ” dr. pujara is an assistant professor of radiology at emory university in atlanta , and continues to go into the hospital . </s>  because of his elevated risk of exposure , he and ms. pujara haven ’ t yet met up with friends , but they have reached out to fellow colleagues to attempt to make play dates for their daughter . </s>  so far , they haven ’ t been successful . </s>  “ i texted one colleague and i said , ‘ hypothetically , would you be interested in a socially distanced play date in your backyard ? ’ ” dr. pujara said . </s>  “ i didn ’ t know how to phrase it , and i didn ’ t really know how to ask. ” his colleague politely passed , offering an excuse that she and her family would be out of town . </s>  “ i don ’ t think she really wanted to answer , ” he admitted . </s>  no matter how uncomfortable it might feel to respond to a social invitation with questions about sanitization and distancing , it ’ s important to be forthright about where your own red lines are , said dr. allen furr , a professor of sociology at auburn university , and not presume that everyone in your circle has the same standards for caution and cleanliness . </s>  “ perception of risk isn ’ t a constant , ” said dr. furr . </s>  “ conflict could arise if somebody asks people over , and the person who is concerned about safety assumes their host is going to take precautions , and then they show up and there aren ’ t any . </s>  it could affect how we view our friends. ” having friends over post-lockdown also creates an added burden for hosts : in addition to ensuring your guests ’ wine

, akko , 2 , in lauris , a small provençal village in the luberon region of france . </s>  france loosened its lockdown on may 11 , just before mr. ben-ami ’ s birthday , a coincidence of timing that ms. baskin felt was the ideal excuse for a party . </s>  she reached out to a handful of close friends to see if they wanted to celebrate together , and opted to simply be straightforward . </s>  “ i didn ’ t want to create a situation where someone felt uncomfortable telling me that they weren ’ t comfortable , so i just asked each person directly : ‘ i ’ m thinking of having a party , we ’ ll be

many people have tested positive , but that ’ s not the same thing , because limits in testing don ’ t give us a full picture . </s>  it would require a full statewide , random sample study to allow us to see what ’ s going on . </s>  that , of course , would require a government that leads . </s>  we ’ ve just seen that happen in indiana . </s>  thanks to a study done with the state ’ s help , we now know that it ’ s likely that about 2.8 percent of hoosiers have so far been infected with this virus . </s>  it also means that the fatality rate in indiana is about 0.6 percent , significantly higher than what we usually see for seasonal influenza . </s>  in some ways the low number of people infected is good news . </s>  social distancing worked . </s>  the hospitals , while strained at times , were never overwhelmed . </s>  the state was able to keep the rate of infection much lower than others , like new york . </s>  it also appears that less than half of those infected are asymptomatic . </s>  this might also account for the lower levels of spread . </s>  in other ways , this news is troubling . </s>  many have hoped that great numbers of americans have been infected , but with no symptoms or very mild illness . </s>  if that were true , we might be able to get to herd immunity with relatively few bad outcomes . </s>  that has always seemed like a long shot , given the experiences of italy and spain . </s>  there , outbreaks raged somewhat more out of control than here in the united states , and those countries experienced surges that outstripped their capacity to provide care . </s>  the indiana study also confirmed what we have long suspected : hispanics , african-americans and other minorities have been disproportionately affected by this pandemic . </s>  other studies in the united states have found different results . </s>  some of those looked only at current coronavirus infections , using the common polymerase chain reaction , or p.c.r. , tests in limited groups . </s>  others tried to use serological testing to look at all infections but were limited to non-random samples , which can yield skewed results . </s>  others looked at limited geographic areas . </s>  doing something more requires a level of support that only government may be able to supply . </s>  this study in indiana sought to be truly statewide and random . </s>  researchers at the indiana university fairbanks school of public health created a data set of all people listed in state tax returns for the last two years . </s>  this included filers , co-filers and dependents . </s>  they linked this list to data from the bureau of motor vehicles and family and social services administration to come up with contact information for everyone . </s>  they then randomly selected people over 12 years of age , making sure to cover individuals from all over the state . </s>  those who agreed to participate were scheduled to be tested at one of 68 state sites and then asked to fill out comprehensive questionnaires about symptoms , health status , behaviors and demographics . </s>  “ given everything involved and especially the aggressive time frame , this study would not have been possible without a steadfast commitment , by the governor , for data-driven decisions , ” said nir menachemi , chairman of the department of health policy at fairbanks and lead author of this study . </s>  logistical support for the testing was handled by both the state department of health and the indiana national guard , along with local police and emergency management personnel . </s>  once participants arrived , trained personnel took nasopharyngeal swabs for viral p.c.r . </s>  testing and blood for antibody testing . </s>  more than 4,600 people participated in the first wave ; 1.7 percent were found to have an active infection . </s>  serological testing , for antibodies , was positive in an additional 1.1 percent of people . </s>  that indicates that overall , 2.8 percent of people living in indiana were infected or have recovered . </s>  given how many people had tested positive by the time this sampling was done , the researchers estimated this meant that about 11 times as many cases likely existed as were known . </s>  this points to a difficult truth : indiana , like most states , is not doing nearly enough testing . </s>  we are failing to pick up 10 out of every 11 cases . </s>  this isn ’ t nearly enough to do adequate contact tracing and isolation . </s>  but we can learn other things from the study . </s>  because the researchers now have a denominator of how many people total were likely infected , they calculated an infection fatality of 0.58 percent . </s>  this isn ’ t nearly as high as many have feared , but it ’ s not a reassuringly low number . </s>  if we achieved herd immunity through outbreaks , and somehow 70 percent of americans , about 225 million people , were infected , more than 1.3 million people might still die . </s>  many more would require hospitalization and intensive care . </s>  there are three important things to learn here . </s>  the first is that states that haven ’ t seen their health care systems crushed have been spared because they have been relatively free of disease . </s>  new york truly does seem to have passed its peak and likely saw far more people exposed and infected than the rest of the country . </s>  indiana ’ s hospitals were stressed , but not overwhelmed , because less than 3 percent of the state was infected . </s>  any state that more closely approached new york ’ s rate would have likely looked more like it , too . </s>  the second is that much of the country still needs to be very careful . </s>  they need to continue to manage this pandemic well though social distancing , much more robust testing and significant contact tracing and isolation . </s>  indiana is not out of the woods ; it has barely entered , even while the state has begun easing restrictions . </s>  the final lesson , however , is that state governments need to do the heavy lifting . </s>  thus far , the federal response has been sorely lacking . </s>  sure , there ’ s lots of hand waving and anecdotal crumbs thrown , but no true mobilizing of resources to do investigative work like this , let alone ramp up the necessary testing and public health work force needed to prevent another lockdown . </s>  we need much more data . </s>  too many states are flying blind , moving ahead without understanding their risk . </s>  there ’ s no excuse for that . </s>  there ’ s no magic to what ’ s just been done in indiana . </s>  all states could do it if they just committed to it . </s>  more need to do so . </s>  no study is perfect , and other states might see different results . </s>  the team in indiana isn ’ t even done testing in their backyard . </s>  “ as valuable is our data has been , it is the next wave , planned for early june , that will be even more valuable , ” said professor menachemi . </s>  “ we plan to test another statewide random sample in a few weeks to determine how much the virus has further spread in indiana . </s>

about , have been elevated , with the wind blowing toward rural areas of russia and belarus for most of the past week . </s>  the wind shifted friday toward kyiv , the ukrainian capital , but authorities say the radiation level is still normal in the city , whose population is about three million . </s>  but saturday ’ s strong winds could spread the fires to the remnants of the nuclear plant and the equipment that was used to clean up the disaster , said kateryna pavlova , the acting head of the agency that oversees the area , in a telephone interview . </s>  “ at the moment , we can not say the fire is contained , ” ms. pavlova said . </s>  after the 1986 chernobyl disaster , authorities created an area around the plant known as the zone of alienation , a rough circle with a

night digging firebreaks around the plant to protect it from fire , ” ms. pavlova said . </s>  the cause has not been determined . </s>  one possibility is that a fire started intentionally by farmers to clear stubble from nearby fields had spread into the zone . </s>  the zone of alienation is an eerie landscape of abandoned villages , equipment “ graves , ” empty fields and dense pine and birch forests , set aside in perpetuity as an experiment in mitigating nuclear disaster . </s>  the idea was to limit , through isolation , the lethality of radiation . </s>  the danger is minimal today . </s>  scientists say the average radiation level in the zone is about a quarter as harmful to human health as it was in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and fire . </s>  radioactive elements degrade at predictable intervals , called half-lives , that can vary enormously . </s>  the average particle half-life at chernobyl is about 30 years . </s>  the main risk from the fires comes from

washington — two of the federal government ’ s top health officials painted a grim picture of the months ahead on tuesday , warning a senate panel that the coronavirus pandemic was far from contained , just a day after president trump declared that “ we have met the moment and we have prevailed. ” the officials — dr. anthony s. fauci , the nation ’ s top infectious disease expert , and dr. robert r. redfield , the director of the centers for disease control and prevention — predicted dire consequences if the nation reopened its economy too soon , noting that the united states still lacked critical testing capacity and the ability to trace the contacts of those infected . </s>  “ if we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes , given that it is without a doubt that there will be infections that will be in the community , then we run the risk of having a resurgence , ” said dr. fauci , the longtime director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , who is at the forefront of efforts to find a coronavirus vaccine . </s>  if states reopen their economies too soon , he warned , “ there is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control , ” which could result not only in “ some suffering and death that could be avoided , but could even set you back on the road to trying to get economic recovery. ” dr. fauci ’ s remarks , during a high-profile — and partly virtual — hearing before the senate committee on health , education , labor and pensions , along with those of dr. redfield , made clear that the nation had not yet prevailed . </s>  they appeared to rattle the markets , driving the s & p 500 down as investors weighed the potential of a second wave of infections against mr. trump ’ s promises that the economy would bounce back once stay-at-home restrictions were lifted . </s>  worrisome reports of spikes in infections in countries like china , south korea and germany , where lockdowns had been lifted , seemed to confirm the american officials ’ fears . </s>  here in washington , dr. fauci and dr. redfield , who have been barred by the white house from appearing before the democratic-controlled house , drew a very different picture of the state of the pandemic than the president , who has cheered for a swift reopening , championed protesters demanding an end to the quarantine and predicted the beginning of a “ transition to greatness. ” dr. fauci told senators that coronavirus therapeutics and a vaccine would almost certainly not be ready in time for the new school year , that outbreaks in other parts of the world would surely reach the united states and that humility in the face of an unpredictable killer meant erring on the side of caution , even with children , who have fared well but have recently shown new vulnerabilities . </s>  dr. redfield pleaded with senators to build up the nation ’ s public health infrastructure , even as he acknowledged that the c.d.c . </s>  had not filled 30 jobs authorized by congress last year to expand its capacity to track outbreaks , and had yet to put in place a “ comprehensive surveillance ” system to monitor outbreaks in nursing homes , which have been hard hit by the pandemic . </s>  “ we are not out of the woods yet , ” he said , “ but we are more prepared. ” the two were among four government doctors — the others were dr. stephen hahn , the commissioner of food and drugs , and adm. brett p. giroir , an assistant secretary for health — who testified remotely during the hearing . </s>

was “ 45 times the rate of south korea. ” the hearing , titled “ covid-19 : safely getting back to work and back to school , ” offered little concrete advice on how that would happen . </s>  it was the first chance lawmakers have had to publicly question the officials in congress since mr. trump declared a national emergency two months ago — and to do so without mr. trump standing nearby . </s>  despite the gloomy predictions for the months ahead , the experts drew a somewhat more upbeat picture over the long term . </s>  asked by senator mitt romney , republican of utah , if the scientists would ultimately develop a vaccine , dr. fauci said : “ it ’ s definitely not a long shot , senator romney . </s>  i would think that it ’ s more likely than not that we will. ” the coronavirus

had 258 deaths from covid-19 , and the united states , which had conducted about 2,000 tests by march 6 . </s>  “ i find our testing record is nothing to celebrate , ” mr. romney said . </s>  for dr. redfield , who has largely been sidelined by mr. trump — at least in the administration ’ s public response — the hearing was a rare opportunity to speak directly to americans , though he often seemed at pains not to showcase any disagreements with the president . </s>  dr. fauci , one of the most visible federal health officials and voices in the pandemic , has had less frequent appearances at the podium the past two weeks , since mr. trump abandoned his daily coronavirus task force briefings . </s>  often the subject of speculation that the president will fire him , dr. fauci reassured senators that their relationship was intact . </s>  “ there is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president , ” he said , adding that when he gives mr. trump advice , “ he

republican of kentucky , pressed his belief that children needed to return to school and told dr. fauci that his voice was not the only one senators would listen to . </s>  “ i think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what ’ s best for the economy , ” mr. paul said . </s>  “ and as much as i respect you , dr. fauci , i don ’ t think you ’ re the end-all . </s>  i don ’ t think you ’ re the one person who gets to make a decision. ” dr. fauci replied , “ we should be humble about what we don ’ t know. ” but , he continued , “ we really better be very careful , particularly when it comes to children , ” because new research is showing that they may not be “ completely immune to the deleterious effects ” of covid-19 . </s>  the white house has put out guidelines for states to follow , called “ opening up america again , ” in planning how to reopen businesses and get people back to work and school . </s>  the plan recommends , among other things ,

contact tracing and “ sentinel surveillance ” testing of asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations , like nursing homes . </s>  but the guidelines are not mandatory , and many states are reopening without adhering to them , seeking to ease the pain as millions of working people and small-business owners are facing economic ruin while sheltering at home . </s>  senator christopher s. murphy ,

wonderful places and opening up these cavernous halls. ’ but we ’ re in a crisis here , we ’ re in a battlefield. ” the comfort was sent to new york to relieve pressure on city hospitals by treating people with ailments other than covid-19 , the illness caused by the coronavirus . </s>  president trump left a nine-day sequester in the white house last week to travel to norfolk , va. , to personally see off the ship as it set sail for new york , saying it would play a “ critical role. ” the ship ’ s arrival on monday was cheered as one of the few bright moments in a grim time for the city . </s>  but the reality has been different . </s>  a tangle of military protocols and bureaucratic hurdles has prevented the comfort from accepting many patients at all . </s>  on top of its strict rules preventing people infected with the virus from coming on board , the navy is also refusing to treat a host of other conditions . </s>  guidelines disseminated to hospitals included a list of 49 medical conditions that would exclude a patient from admittance to the ship . </s>  ambulances can not take patients directly to the comfort ; they must first deliver patients to a city hospital for a lengthy evaluation — including a test for the virus — and then pick them up again for transport to the ship . </s>  at a morning briefing on thursday , officials said three patients had been moved to the comfort . </s>  after the new york times published an article with that number , elizabeth baker , a spokeswoman for the navy , said the number had increased to 20 by late in the day .

people are dying that the city is running low on body bags . </s>  at the same time , there is not a high volume of noncoronavirus patients . </s>  because most new yorkers have isolated themselves in their homes , there are fewer injuries from car accidents , gun shots and construction accidents that would require an emergency room visit . </s>  ultimately , mr. dowling and others said , if the comfort refuses to take covid patients , there are few patients to send . </s>  and given the pernicious spread of the disease in new york city , where nearly 50,000 were infected as of thursday , dividing patients into those who have it and those who do not is pointless , he said . </s>  the solution , he and others said , was to open the comfort to patients with covid-19 . </s>  “ it ’ s pretty ridiculous , ” he said . </s>  “ if you ’ re not going to help us with the people we need help with , what ’ s the purpose ? ” asked about mr. dowling ’ s criticisms , the defense department

another alternative site operated by the military , with 2,500 hospital beds . </s>  “ i asked president trump this morning to consider the request and the urgency of the matter , and the president

amersbach , the commanding officer of the medical personnel aboard the comfort , said at a news conference that , for now , his orders were to accept only patients who had tested negative for the virus . </s>  if ordered to accept coronavirus patients , he said , the ship could be reconfigured to make that happen . </s>  “ if our mission shifts , we do what we can to meet that mission , ” he said . </s>  from the outset , readying the hospital ship for use in a pandemic proved a challenge . </s>  the comfort was built to operate in battlefield conditions , and its physicians accustomed to treating young , otherwise healthy soldiers suffering from injuries related to gunshots and bomb blasts . </s>  most people who are hospitalized with covid-19 are older and infected with a novel pathogen that even the world ’ s top medical researchers do not fully understand . </s>  any outbreak on board could quickly spread and disable the ship ’ s operations . </s>  as a precaution , the ship ’ s crew isolated for two weeks before embarking on their mission to new york . </s>  they must remain onboard for the duration of their mission in new york . </s>  the ship has struggled to fulfill civilian missions in the past . </s>  after hurricane maria pummeled puerto rico in 2017 , the comfort was sent to relieve overextended hospitals , but ended up treating only a handful of patients each day . </s>  a military physician who had previously served on the navy ’ s hospital ships said in an interview that conditions on board were suitable for soldiers , but , with its narrow bunked cots instead of modern hospital beds , it was not ideal for treating civilians . </s>  though military physicians are accustomed to battlefield situations , they are well-trained , and should be able to handle strains of the pandemic if ordered to treat patients with the coronavirus , he said . </s>  “ as military doctors , ” he said , “ they would absolutely do their best. ” michael d. shear contributed reporting . </s>    after going through a harrowing bout of postpartum depression with her first child , my patient , emily , had done everything possible to prepare for the postpartum period with her second . </s>  she stayed in treatment with me , her perinatal psychiatrist , and together we made the decision for her to continue zoloft during her pregnancy . </s>  with the combination of medication , psychotherapy and a significant amount of planning , she was feeling confident about her delivery in april . </s>  and then , the coronavirus hit . </s>  emily , whose name has been changed for privacy reasons , called me in late-march because she was having trouble sleeping . </s>  she was up half the night ruminating about whether she ’ d be able to have her husband with her for delivery and how to manage taking care of a toddler and a newborn without help . </s>  the cloud that we staved off for so long was returning , and emily felt powerless to stop it . </s>  postpartum depression and the larger group of maternal mental health conditions called perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are caused by neurobiological factors and environmental stressors . </s>  pregnancy and the postpartum period are already vulnerable times for women due in part to the hormonal fluctuations accompanying pregnancy and delivery , as well as the sleep deprivation of the early postpartum period . </s>  now , fears about the health of an unborn child or an infant and the consequences of preventive measures , like social distancing , have added more stress . </s>  as a psychiatrist who specializes in taking care of pregnant and postpartum women , i ’ ve seen an increase in intrusive worry , obsessions , compulsions , feelings of hopelessness and insomnia in my patients during the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  and i ’ m not alone in my observations : worldwide , mental health professionals are concerned . </s>  a special editorial in a scandinavian gynecological journal called attention to the psychological distress that pregnant women and new mothers will experience in a prolonged global pandemic . </s>  a report from zhejiang university in china detailed the case of a woman who contracted covid-19 late in her pregnancy and developed depressive symptoms . </s>  in the united states , maternal mental health experts have also described an increase in patients with clinical anxiety . </s>  in non-pandemic times , as many as 14 percent of women will suffer from pregnancy-related anxiety , which refers to fears that women have about their own health and their baby ’ s over the course of pregnancy and delivery , and up to 20 percent of women will experience postpartum depression . </s>  samantha meltzer-brody , m.d. , m.p.h. , who is the chair of the department of psychiatry at the university of north carolina at chapel hill and the director of the center for women ’ s mood disorders , said , “ the natural vulnerability of this major life transition is exacerbated when you just have sort of global anxiety , and things like going to the grocery store to pick up diapers suddenly become a much more anxiety-producing event than it ever was before. ” dr. meltzer-brody explained that the higher levels of stress in perinatal women increase their risk for developing a clinical disorder , such as perinatal depression or anxiety . </s>  in my clinical practice and in a covid-19 maternal well-being group i co-founded , women have voiced their fears about a number of possible distressing scenarios : delivering without a support person ; being one of the 15 percent of pregnant women who is asymptomatic for covid-19 and facing possible infant separation ; and recovering during a postpartum period without the help of family or friends to provide support . </s>  there ’ s also grief about the loss of a hopeful time that was meant to be celebrated with loved ones . </s>  pregnant women and new mothers must also deal with the constant low-grade panic that comes with making decisions that have no specific medical guidelines , such as : what should i do if i have other kids at home and the only person who can help me is a grandparent who is at high risk ? </s>  what kind of precautions should i take if my partner is a health care worker ? </s>  is it ok to send my kid back to day care ? </s>  without clear right answers , the mental load of these decisions defaults to mothers . </s>  as part of its ongoing pregnancy during the pandemic research program , the university of calgary has been examining symptoms of depression , general anxiety , pregnancy-specific anxiety , as well as levels of sleep and social support of pregnant women in canada using self-reported questionnaires . </s>  early findings , which have not yet been published nor peer reviewed , indicate higher than normal levels of clinically relevant depression and anxiety symptoms in pregnancy in those who took the survey . </s>  the

associate professor of radiology at the university of calgary , said higher levels of depression and anxiety are “ particularly concerning in pregnancy because struggles with mental health can impact not just the pregnant woman herself , but also her baby. ” as part of the parenting during the pandemic research program , researchers at the university of manitoba have been examining how mothers are faring while pregnant and parenting children up to age 8 during the pandemic . </s>  early findings , which also have not yet been published nor peer reviewed , suggest an increase in self-reported symptoms of clinically relevant depression and anxiety in mothers with children in all age groups . </s>  given that many mothers are caring for infants while home-schooling children , the study ’ s lead author , emily cameron , a doctoral candidate at the university of calgary and a clinical psychology resident at the university of manitoba , said there ’ s a clear need to develop affordable clinical services that take into account the increased parenting demands during the pandemic . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › let us help you better understand the coronavirus are coronavirus case

are more likely to develop postpartum depression . </s>  supportive relationships during pregnancy can protect against postpartum depression . </s>  while it ’ s still too early in the covid era to point to conclusive data about which populations are most vulnerable , dr. meltzer-brody noted that if we extrapolate from what we know about risk factors for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders pre-covid , it ’ s reasonable to believe women who have a lifetime history of anxiety or depression are going to be harder hit by the negative effects of social isolation . </s>  leslie e. roos , ph.d. , an assistant professor in the department of psychology at the university of manitoba and principle investigator of the parenting during the pandemic project , said , “ a potential important point of public health intervention would be to reach out to families where there were prior mental health concerns to check in proactively about how those families are doing. ” black communities in the united states have been disproportionately affected by covid-19 . </s>  i ’ m particularly worried for black mothers who are not only more likely to suffer from postpartum depression and less likely to receive treatment , but are also more likely to be infected with or have a loved one die from covid-19 than their white peers . </s>  while acknowledging we are just beginning to learn about the magnitude of the virus ’ s effect on pregnant women and new moms , stacey d. stewart , the president and chief executive of the march of dimes , said , “ we just have to assume that during times when the health systems are stressed the way they are , that those already existing systemic issues are probably made even worse. ” in the case of my patient emily , we caught her symptoms early , increased her medication dosage and met more frequently for psychotherapy . </s>  her postpartum period was not at all what she expected it to be , but with proper treatment and support , she began to feel like herself again . </s>  still , i ’ m scared for the woman with bipolar disorder who may lose her insurance , go off her medication and end up hospitalized . </s>  and the pregnant health care worker who is faced with balancing the needs of her unborn child , and the needs of her patients . </s>  i ’ m urging women not to wait to seek help . </s>  it can be tempting to dismiss your symptoms

always follow bear markets , and there is little doubt that the steep market decline driven by the coronavirus pandemic will lead to a severe economic downturn . </s>  how bad it gets will depend on

if goldman sachs thinks the u.s. economy will shrink by 5 percent and deutsche bank expects a 13 percent fall ? </s>  it ’ s going to be bad , and the shape of the downturn is what many are focusing on now . </s>  will it be a v- , u- or l-shaped recovery ? </s>  calls for a short , sharp downturn — a v-shaped decline and rebound — have been fading away , as widespread business shutdowns and “ social distancing ” orders suggest that it could be a while before things return to normal . </s>  that implies a more gradual u-shaped trajectory . </s>  in the worst-case scenario , the drop in activity lasts so long that it resembles an “ l ” : falling fast and then staying low . </s>  the shape of bailouts is also emerging , with senate republicans presenting their $ 1 trillion proposal

</s>    last fall bob kroll , the head of the minneapolis police union , appeared at a trump rally , where he thanked the president for ending barack obama ’ s “ oppression of police ” and letting cops “ put the handcuffs on criminals instead of us. ” the events of the past week , in which the death of george floyd in minneapolis police custody led to demonstrations against police brutality , and these demonstrations were met by more police brutality — including unprecedented violence against the news media — have made it clear what kroll meant by taking the handcuffs off . </s>  and donald trump , far from trying to calm the nation , is pouring gasoline on the fire ; he seems very close to trying to incite a civil war . </s>  i don ’ t think it ’ s an exaggeration to say that america as we know it is on the brink . </s>  how did we get here ? </s>  the core story of u.s. politics over the past four decades is that wealthy elites weaponized white racism to gain political power , which they used to pursue policies that enriched the already wealthy at workers ’ expense . </s>  until trump ’ s rise it was possible — barely — for people to deny this reality with a straight face . </s>  at this point , however , it requires willful blindness not to see what ’ s going on . </s>  i still see occasional news reports that describe trump as a “ populist. ” but trump ’ s economic policies have been the opposite of populist : they have been relentlessly plutocratic , centered largely on a successful effort to ram through huge tax cuts for corporations and the rich , and a so far unsuccessful attempt to take health insurance away from poor and working-class families . </s>  nor have trump ’ s trade wars brought back the good jobs of yore . </s>  even before the coronavirus plunged us into depression , trump had failed to deliver major employment growth in coal mining or manufacturing . </s>  and farmers , who supported trump by large margins in 2016 , have suffered huge losses thanks to his trade wars . </s>  so what has trump really offered to the white working class that makes up most of his base ? </s>  basically , he has provided affirmation and cover for racial hostility . </s>  and nowhere is this clearer than in his relationship with the police . </s>  if economic self-interest were the only thing driving political orientation , you would expect police officers to favor democrats . </s>  they are , after all , unionized public-sector employees — and republicans are both anti-union and anti-government . </s>  they don ’ t make enough money to benefit much from the trump tax cut . </s>  their jobs will be very much at risk if revenue-starved state and local governments are forced to make drastic spending cuts — and trump ’ s allies in the senate are blocking the aid that might avert such cuts . </s>  indeed , political contributions by public-sector unions overwhelmingly favor democrats . </s>  and while many firefighters voted for trump in 2016 , the largest firefighters ’ union has endorsed joe biden . </s>  but many police officers and their unions remain staunch trump supporters , and they have been pretty clear about why : they feel that trump will back them even , or perhaps especially , if they engage in abusive behavior toward racial minorities . </s>  just to be clear , many and probably most police officers have behaved well over the past week . </s>  in fact , in some cities the police have shown solidarity with protesters , joining marches or taking a knee . </s>  but trump clearly sides with those who reject any notion that police officers — or any other authority figures — should be held accountable for abusive behavior . </s>  remember , he ’ s used his authority to pardon members of the u.s. military who were accused or convicted by their own services of committing war crimes . </s>  in a call with governors on monday , he showed no sign of recognizing either that there might be some justification for widespread protests or that he should play some role in unifying the nation . </s>  instead , he told the governors that all the violence was coming from the “ radical left , ” and he insisted that governors must get tougher : “ you have to dominate or you ’ ll look like a bunch of jerks ; you have to arrest and try people. ” trump — who retreated to an underground bunker when protesters began demonstrating in front of the white house — also told the governors that “ most of you are weak. ” it was a terrifying performance . </s>  republicans have , as i said , spent decades exploiting racial hostility to win elections despite a policy agenda that hurts workers . </s>  but trump is now pushing that cynical strategy toward a kind of apotheosis . </s>  on one side , he ’ s effectively inciting violence by his supporters . </s>  on the other , he ’ s very close to calling for a military response to social protest . </s>  and at this point , nobody expects any significant pushback from other republicans . </s>  now , i don ’ t think trump will actually succeed in provoking a race war in the near future , even though he ’ s clearly itching for an excuse to use force . </s>  but the months ahead are still likely to be very , very ugly . </s>  after all , if trump is encouraging violence and talking about military solutions to overwhelmingly peaceful protests , what

about trying to socially distance yourself from the president ’ s handling of the crisis . </s>  mr. trump ’ s leadership during this national emergency has not wowed the american public — at least not in a good way . </s>  the republican faithful may continue to back him unconditionally , but polls show that a majority of the electorate gives him negative reviews . </s>  and the shakier the president ’ s numbers look , the more nervous fellow republicans become . </s>  on monday , the senate majority leader , mitch mcconnell , whose moral compass points always toward keeping his grip on power , cautioned that this year ’ s battle for the chamber would be “ a dogfight ” and a “ knife fight ” — choose your own bloody metaphor . </s>  even with a favorable electoral map , mr. mcconnell & co. fear that the president ’ s pandemic performance could hurt them in november . </s>  at the same time , mr. trump ’ s enduring popularity with the base means that his teammates can not risk looking anything less than 100 percent loyal . </s>  what ’ s a self-serving republican to do ? </s>  the national republican senatorial committee recently distributed a memo with guidance on how to split this political baby : when discussing the coronavirus , candidates should fully embrace the president ’ s efforts to shift the blame fully onto china . </s>  but — and here ’ s the part that caught team trump ’ s eye — “ don ’ t defend trump. ” prepared by a top party strategist , the bulk of the 57-page memo provides tips , talking points , timelines and background data geared toward making this crisis all about china . </s>  the “ short version ” summary suggests condemning china not only for causing the pandemic but also for stealing jobs , tossing religious minorities in concentration camps and flooding the united states with fentanyl . </s>  democratic opponents are to be tarred as “ soft on china ” and unwilling to “ stand up to the chinese communist party , ” they recommend , while republicans vow to “ bring our manufacturing jobs back home ” and to work to punish china with sanctions . </s>  drugs , religious persecution , stolen jobs , commie lovers — the vilification blueprint offers something for every leg of the republican stool and fits nicely with mr. trump ’ s trademark scapegoating : the weaker and less competent this president looks , the more vigorously he and his allies endeavor to gin up anger at an external enemy . </s>  the trouble arises when the memo offers defenses to a couple of “ likely attacks/questions , ” no . </s>  1 being “ isn ’ t this trump ’ s fault ? ” republicans are urged , in italics , “ note — don ’ t defend trump , other than the china travel ban — attack china. ” one bullet point suggests expressing gentle disappointment over the delayed response : “ i wish that everyone acted earlier — that includes our elected officials , the world health organization , and the cdc. ” gentle or not , team trump was peeved at the prospect of his senate team treating the administration ’ s response as anything less than perfect — and , even more arrogantly , thinking of their political fortunes as somehow separate from the president ’ s . </s>  this could not stand . </s>  top officials from the trump campaign swiftly moved to let the republican senate committee know it had messed up . </s>  on monday , a trump political adviser , justin clark , warned the senate campaign committee ’ s executive director , kevin mclaughlin , that any candidates engaged in such treachery should not expect support from the president ’ s campaign — and risked losing the love of the base . </s>  “ candidates will listen to the bad advice in this memo at their own peril , ” mr. clark told politico . </s>  confronted with this threat , mr. mclaughlin backpedaled furiously . </s>  “ there is no daylight between the nrsc and president trump , ” he responded . </s>  “ senate republicans have worked hand in glove with the trump administration to ensure a highly effective federal response to covid-19. ” it is tempting to criticize the trump campaign for its heavy-handed tactics and its demand for total obeisance from ostensibly independent lawmakers . </s>  in reality , why should the president expect anything less ? </s>  most republican senators made their pact with the devil long ago , letting mr. trump get away with pretty much whatever he wanted . </s>  even so , it has been their response to mr. trump ’ s handling of this pandemic that has shown what his republican enablers are truly made of . </s>  day after day , the president has come before the nation in news briefings and on twitter , spreading not simply nonsense but dangerous nonsense — downplaying the risks of the virus , peddling quack remedies , misrepresenting the availability of diagnostic testing and protective equipment , picking fights with governors struggling to protect their states and , of course , deflecting blame onto everyone from the world health organization to the obama administration . </s>  through it all , few republicans have managed to muster even a peep of protest . </s>  and they have been happy to promote the president ’ s story that everything is china ’ s fault — just as they have supported his efforts to turn an apolitical pandemic into a partisan battle between red and blue states . </s>  senate republicans have sold their souls to donald trump , and it ’ s absurd for them to pretend otherwise . </s>  when they try , they deserve to be smacked : by democrats , by the media and , yes , by the president himself . </s>  voters will have their say soon enough . </s>  the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor . </s>  we ’ d like to hear what you think

department officials announced that the other services would follow suit . </s>  the united states and its military partners in south korea and europe have canceled planned exercises in the arctic , the middle east and south korea . </s>  but troops who had already arrived for another large-scale exercise , in eastern europe along the border with russia , will continue with the planned war games , albeit on a smaller scale . </s>  and on monday , officials working at the defense department began “ social distancing ” for meetings inside the pentagon , spreading across multiple rooms while video conferencing , and sitting several feet apart when at the same table . </s>  but uniformed troops were still conducting tours on wednesday for visitors at the building , where groups clustered in front of paintings and points of interests . </s>  the pentagon , as it turns out , is a microcosm of the inherent contradictions in how companies , government agencies and people across the country are trying to battle the coronavirus . </s>  the sprawling five-sided building is a workplace for close to 30,000 people , including civilian and military workers who parachute in from hot

the ones overseas and in the united states where the coronavirus has taken hold . </s>  and like companies across the country , the defense department is grappling with just how draconian it should get in its guidelines for how to respond to , and contain , the virus . </s>  the contradictions abound . </s>  at the heavily trafficked subway entrance to the building on tuesday , a stand of handsanitizer appeared . </s>  but putting such stands throughout the building , with its miles of corridors , has yet to become standard practice . </s>  the mixed nature of the defense department ’ s response is mirrored around washington . </s>  on capitol hill , where many congressional members are in the older cohort most endangered by the virus , some representatives were observing hand-washing and no-touching protocols ( a lot of the first , not much of the last ) while others were not . </s>  in alexandria , va. , two local health workers who had just insisted that they were

yellow zone . </s>  so you have people choosing , electing one path or another . </s>  there ’ s a lot of variance. ” part of that variance stems from the fact that the slow pace of testing for the virus in the united states has meant that americans are not aware of the extent of contagion here . </s>  in fact , the pentagon acknowledged on tuesday that the military ’ s official tally of service members and defense department civilians who had been infected probably undercounts the total . </s>  “ i think that it is likely , given what we are seeing around the world , and the fact that we have people all over the world , that there are more , ” brig . </s>  gen. paul friedrichs , the joint staff surgeon , said during a news briefing . </s>  that is an important detail because the low average age and good health of american troops means that they are better able to withstand the virus if they get it . </s>  but it also means that they are more likely to become carriers who do not show symptoms , yet may infect other people . </s>  the army was the first to order its troops to defer from deployment to italy and south korea . </s>  “ force health protection is the army ’ s top priority , ” the army said in a statement . </s>  referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus , it continued , “ protecting the force includes mitigating the spread of the virus and ensuring personnel have the most up-to-date information on appropriate measures to prevent potential spread of covid-19. ” the navy , marines and air force followed suit on wednesday . </s>  this means that troops changing their home station to anywhere in south korea or italy must now put their plans on hold . </s>  for those in transit , according to one army officer , they are stuck in travel limbo , wedged between their last duty station and awaiting some sort of clarity on where to go next . </s>  “ d.o.d . </s>  is taking steps within its senior leadership to lead by example on

control pension funds , mutual fund operators , and insurance companies — are typically restricted in where they can invest . </s>  many are obligated to hold the safest bonds . </s>  when corporate

floor-grazing trousers . </s>  designers also rendered their tunics in colorful prints : virgil abloh opted for surreal florals at louis vuitton , and silvia venturini fendi showed a style adorned

way to support the restaurant business by nick marino when the coronavirus hit , woody and helena hambrecht , the husband-and-wife team behind the sonoma county , calif. , aperitif brand haus , discovered something miraculous . </s>  their business , founded just last year , didn ’ t crater as they had feared . </s>  it skyrocketed . </s>  since january , sales for their direct-to-consumer , low-alcohol-content drinks — made on their 200-acre ranch with natural ingredients such as ginger , cinnamon , yuzu and elderflower — are up about 500 percent . </s>  “ i ’ m sure it has something to do with e-commerce growing , ” helena says . </s>  the hospitality industry , though , is suffering a profoundly different outcome , and so the couple have spent the past several weeks developing the restaurant project : a line of aperitifs based on the flavor profiles of the food menus at more than a dozen influential restaurants around america , including kismet in los angeles ( whose recipe contains beet , hibiscus and rose ) , marlow & sons in brooklyn ( grapefruit , fig leaf and vanilla ) and compère lapin in new orleans ( passion fruit and lemongrass ) . </s>  haus is donating 100 percent of the profits from every bottle to each respective restaurant with the goal of helping chefs pay their bills and staffs until they can reopen . </s>  “ we ’ ve already had pretty much every

the natural world by samuel rutter best known for his large-scale public sculptures — like “ santa cruz ( blunk ’ s hunk ) ” ( 1968 ) , a gnarled piece of redwood carved like a boat — j.b. blunk was also a proficient painter and jeweler who turned his inverness , calif. , home into a showcase for the artistic splendor of natural materials , including redwood burls and stones made smooth by the eel river , which he foraged himself in the north of the state . </s>  given his output and the fact that , in the 1950s , he was an apprentice to japanese masters like rosanjin and kaneshige toyo , it ’ s surprising that no monograph on his life and work has existed until now . </s>  “ j.b . </s>  blunk , ” which publishes tomorrow , has been meticulously curated by mariah nielson , blunk ’ s daughter and the director of his estate , and spans the artist ’ s long and varied career . </s>  what makes his oeuvre so exceptional , according to nielson , is “ the confluence and synergy between life and work , and the fact that he didn ’ t distinguish between art , design and craft the way we do in western culture. ” the book is laid out to reflect blunk ’ s approach : images of sculptures of wood and stone sit alongside those of early ceramic works and items of gold jewelry , many of which served as studies for the sculptures . </s>  its release was initially meant to coincide with blunk ’ s first ( and also long-overdue ) solo show in new york , at the kasmin gallery , which will now take place in the fall and feature works from both the artist ’ s home and private collections

at polling data and survey research on the candidates , voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election . </s>  if the presidential election were held today , polls in crucial swing states like florida , michigan and pennsylvania suggest that joseph r. biden jr. would be in position for a narrow victory . </s>  the disquieting news for democrats is that at the same point in 2016 , hillary clinton was in a better position . </s>  some americans have lost faith in president trump ’ s handling of the coronavirus crisis , but the country ’ s deeply entrenched partisan divide has prevented the president from losing more than a few percentage points on his overall approval rating . </s>  besides , the electoral college has a meaningful republican tilt , and those who turn out to vote tend to be slightly more conservative than the general population . </s>  add to that republicans ’ efforts to limit access to voting among predominantly democratic populations , and mr. trump might well become the first president in history to win two full terms without once winning a plurality of the popular vote . </s>  state polls proved problematic during the 2016 presidential race — that much is well known . </s>  but with no guarantee that a repeat won ’ t occur this year , it bears noting that mrs. clinton was considerably further ahead of mr. trump in many swing state polls in spring 2016 than mr. biden is now . </s>  real clear politics polling averages show mr. biden leading mr. trump in most polls of florida , michigan , pennsylvania and wisconsin . </s>  but on average , the former vice president ’ s lead in each of those states ’ aggregates is only about half what mrs. clinton ’ s was at this point in 2016 , six months before she was defeated . </s>  trump ’ s ‘ golden rule ’ applies during the crisis . </s>  so far the golden rule of mr. trump ’ s presidency — that his approval ratings shall not budge more than a few percentage points — has held true throughout the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  since the start of this year , his ratings have wavered but never left the mid- to high 40s . </s>  that carries over into perceptions of how mr. trump has dealt with the coronavirus specifically . </s>  and , importantly , it holds true in swing states . </s>  a university of new hampshire poll released this week had encouraging news for mr. trump . </s>  while his overall virus approval rating in that state remained underwater , independents ’ approval jumped in the past month by 21 percentage points , showing that his message — inconsistent though it may be — is still persuasive for some key voters . </s>  surveys released this week of florida , michigan and pennsylvania found approval of his handling of the pandemic varying from 44 percent to 46 percent of registered voters in those states , reflective of the national average . </s>  in michigan and pennsylvania , biden doesn ’ t necessarily benefit from people ’ s support of democratic governors . </s>  these new state polls show that even in places where mr. trump has clashed with popular democratic governors , mr. biden will not be able to lean on support for state-level democrats in his fight against the president . </s>  the new washington live updates updated jan. 29 , 2021 , 9:45 p.m . </s>  et the retired general in charge of the air force academy alumni association refuses to condemn jan. 6 riot , angering its members . </s>  brian sicknick , the capitol police officer who died from injuries at the capitol riot , will lie in honor in the rotunda . </s>  biden intelligence briefings to be led by veteran c.i.a . </s>  officer , who previously briefed george w. bush . </s>  in fox news polls of michigan and pennsylvania , well over three in five voters approved of their democratic governor ’ s job performance , including large majorities of independents and moderates . </s>  but in each case , that was far more than those who said they would vote for mr. biden in november . </s>  and voters appear to see their governor as separate from their vote in the presidential election . </s>  in a hypothetical matchup against mr. trump , mr. biden didn ’ t do markedly better when michigan voters were asked about a hypothetical ticket that included their governor , gretchen whitmer , as his running mate . </s>  in each case , 49 percent said they would vote for mr. biden over mr. trump . </s>  in florida , biden emerges from the primary race looking weakened — but with room to grow . </s>  a quinnipiac university poll of florida released on wednesday showed mr. biden with a slight edge among registered voters , but that spread of four percentage points was within the margin of error . </s>  mr. biden has fallen since june , when he led mr. trump , 50 percent to 41 percent . </s>  biden ’ s victorious campaign for the democratic nomination has done little to put wind in the former vice president ’ s sails , but rather has left him in a slightly worse position in a matchup against mr. trump than when he began . </s>  and with the pandemic keeping mr. biden holed up in delaware , he has struggled to command a bully pulpit since becoming the democrats ’ presumptive nominee . </s>  mr. biden ’ s favorability rating is now just 43 percent among registered voters in florida , down from 49 percent in a quinnipiac poll of the state a year ago . </s>  his plus-3 net favorability rating there is now within the margin of error . </s>  still , 14 percent of floridians haven ’ t made up their mind about him , meaning he has far more room to grow than does mr. trump , whose net rating is minus-7 . </s>  hispanic voters play an important role in florida , and in this demographic mr. biden looks anemic . </s>  he lost the hispanic vote to senator bernie sanders in many primaries and caucuses this year , and the new quinnipiac poll of florida shows him leading mr. trump by just eight percentage points among hispanic voters , 46 percent to 38 percent . </s>  in 2016 , both pre-election surveys and exit polls showed mrs. clinton leading mr. trump by three times as many percentage points among hispanic voters in florida . </s>  among black voters there , too , mr. biden shows signs of surprising weakness . </s>  twelve percent said they did not yet know whom they would support , a higher rate of uncertainty than in other demographics . </s>  young voters remain lukewarm on biden . </s>  young people are a demographic in which mr. biden badly underperforms compared with most recent democratic presidential nominees . </s>  in florida , voters under 35 are actually more likely to see mr. biden unfavorably than to hold a positive view of him . </s>  but 27 percent say they don ’ t know enough to feel one way or the other , so he has room to improve . </s>  he leads mr. trump by just nine percentage points among florida voters under 35 , a relatively weak edge compared with mrs. clinton ’ s lead of 22 percentage points among this group in a quinnipiac poll at this point in 2016 . </s>  among millennials in michigan , mr. biden squeaks by with just a 50 percent to 45 percent favorability rating , according to the fox news poll . </s>  he leads mr. trump by just eight percentage points among millennials in a head-to-head matchup . </s>  older voters like biden , and don ’ t like trump ’ s virus response . </s>  mr. biden tends to make up for his relatively weak leads among millennials and hispanic voters with his strength among those 65 and older . </s>  compared with mrs. clinton ’ s 2016 totals , polls suggest mr. biden has made the most gains among the oldest voters . </s>  these voters have largely been unimpressed with mr. trump ’ s handling of the coronavirus crisis , and they will be particularly crucial if mr. biden expects to win florida , which has trended republican over the past 10 years . </s>  those 65 and over broke for mr. trump by 17 percentage points in 2016 . </s>  in the fox polls of michigan and pennsylvania , and the quinnipiac poll of florida , the oldest voters were consistently the most likely to say that their states should err on the side of keeping their economies closed out of a concern for safety — a stance that mr. trump has been reluctant to embrace . </s>  in florida , gov . </s>  ron desantis , a republican , resisted calls for weeks to put in place a statewide stay-at-home order , and his handling of the crisis has drawn some of the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country . </s>    from the first protests and parades in new york city 50 years ago to the celebrations that span the world today , pride has always been about being seen — not just by the l.g.b.t.q . </s>  community but by everyone . </s>  but this year , the coronavirus pandemic has put a halt on mass gatherings , and pride events have been canceled or postponed in new york , san francisco and los angeles as well as in indianapolis , charlottesville , va. , birmingham , ala. , and more than 300 other cities globally . </s>  for many , this means missing out on what can be a pivotal moment of visibility and acceptance : their first pride . </s>  “ i ’ m pretty sure i was going to be very emotional on the day of pride , ” said marc castenada , 25 , who grew up in texas and planned to join his first pride
