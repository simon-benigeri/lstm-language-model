video by alexander stockton dr. andres maldonado normally bounded into the emergency department , fit and vigorous , but this time he had to be escorted in , pale and fighting for breath , with a patient bracelet on his right wrist . </s>  a nurse , seeing her colleague struggle , burst into tears . </s>  maldonado was 27 , a third-year resident physician with no underlying medical conditions . </s>  when he came down with a fever on march 23 , he called in sick . </s>  soon he developed a tightness in his chest and tested positive for the coronavirus . </s>  at first he resisted the idea of seeking treatment . </s>  he was by nature stoical ; in youth soccer games , other boys had crumpled when injured , but maldonado always got up and limped through his pain . </s>  now as a doctor — a badass emergency doctor , he jokingly called himself — he was humiliated by the thought of becoming a patient . </s>  but on march 31 , so out of breath he could barely get to the bathroom , he called his older brother , nestor , also an emergency physician , who remembers panic in andres ’ s voice . </s>  “ it hurts to breathe , ” andres told his brother . </s>  “ my body aches all over . </s>  i ’ ve been having really bad fevers , and i ’ m getting , like , dizzy. ” “ yo , ” his brother ordered him , “ get your butt to the e.r. ” maldonado called his parents to say that he was going to the hospital . </s>  his dad , jose maldonado , was a refugee from the civil war in el salvador who started life over as a dishwasher in new york . </s>  his mom , cecilia aguilar-maldonado , came from ecuador , and both were undocumented for a time — yet they sent both sons through medical school . </s>  the parents were the first of many to be devastated by their son ’ s sickness . </s>  “ i just went down on my knees , ” his mother recalled later . </s>  “ i just implored god for mercy. ” she told her husband , and he began crying as she had never seen him cry before : “ he was asking god to please save andres and take him instead. ” maldonado called ahead to the jacobi medical center , one of several hospitals in the bronx where he worked , and doctors there were waiting for him and gave him a room in the emergency department . </s>  kelly cabrera , a nurse who often worked beside him , spotted him and was puzzled . </s>  “ what are you doing here ? ” she asked . </s>  gasping for breath , he explained that he had covid-19 . </s>  “ i tried to stay home , ” he told her , embarrassed that he was giving his colleagues more work . </s>  “ i got kicked in the stomach , ” cabrera recounted . </s>  “ he was one of our own. ” cabrera and the other nurses , all of whom knew maldonado well , took blood and gave him oxygen and tylenol . </s>  several scrawled a big message and placed it on the window facing him : “ we love you. ” cabrera stepped out , weeping and also cursing . </s>  “ i felt incredible anger , ” she said — at america ’ s lack of preparation for the virus , at shortages of protective equipment , at official dithering that had left maldonado and other medical workers at risk . </s>  at least 145 health care professionals have died of covid-19 in the united states , according to an unofficial list kept by medscape . </s>  doctors in the e.r . </s>  saw that maldonado ’ s condition was deteriorating . </s>  a new wave of fever swept over him , and he curled into a ball . </s>  his heart rate shot up to 130 , and he was taking 35 breaths a minute , more than twice his normal rate . </s>  he couldn ’ t finish a sentence without running out of air . </s>  the doctors decided to rush maldonado into the intensive care unit and put him on high-flow oxygen . </s>  maldonado had been sharing his lab results and x-rays with his girlfriend , dr. katherine auwarter , an ob-gyn resident in greenville , s.c. , and now he texted her that he was being admitted to the i.c.u . </s>  she called immediately . </s>  “ i ’ m being admitted , ” he told her weakly , and his voice broke . </s>  “ i ’ m so scared. ” “ i ’ m going to buy a plane ticket right now , ” she told him . </s>  and then , she said , they both broke down . </s>  she knew that what terrified maldonado most was intubation and attachment to a ventilator : he knew that a great majority of patients intubated for covid-19 never recovered . </s>  doctors hadn ’ t directly raised with maldonado the possibility of intubation , but he could see his oxygen levels slide — and his doctors kept an intubation cart outside his room , just in case . </s>  when a patient is transferred from the e.r . </s>  to another floor , an orderly and a nurse typically roll the stretcher there . </s>  in this case , the emergency department staff gathered to wish him well , and two attending physicians and a nurse together pushed maldonado ’ s stretcher to the i.c.u . </s>  doctors tried to smile reassuringly — but it was a front . </s>  “ i was terrified , ” recalled dr. michael p. jones , the head of the resident program . </s>  jones went back to his office , closed the door , lowered his head on his desk and cried . </s>  in the i.c.u. , maldonado was placed on a high-flow nasal cannula to force oxygen into his lungs . </s>  these devices have a good record of helping covid-19 patients but are in short supply , and not all american hospitals have them . </s>  his doctors believed that his life was in danger partly because of his body ’ s own immune response , creating a cytokine storm attacking the vital organs . </s>  doctors proposed using an experimental drug , tocilizumab , to suppress his immune response . </s>  this has sometimes been used successfully with coronavirus patients but can also cause serious side effects ; feeling desperate , maldonado agreed . </s>  the next day he was breathing a bit better , and the fever was gone . </s>  slowly over several days his lungs cleared . </s>  after six days , he was discharged . </s>  the residency program insisted that he take two weeks to recover , and he used the time to reflect on life and the practice of medicine . </s>  when he was in the e.r . </s>  as a patient , he had wanted to go to the toilet but couldn ’ t walk that far , and he was mortified at the thought of using a bedpan and having a nurse wipe his bottom . </s>  so he held it in , learning empathy for patient concerns that is difficult to teach in medical school . </s>  he now urges people to be careful and to stay home . </s>  “ i hear your frustration , ” he says of those protesting to restart the economy , “ but what good is all the things you ’ re protesting for if you ’ re dead ? ” another lesson : don ’ t be a stoic and delay seeking help when it ’ s necessary . </s>  “ the key to all of that was the early initiation of the high-flow nasal cannula , ” said dr. noe romo . </s>  “ andres was at the point where if we had waited a little longer , i don ’ t think the high flow would have been as effective. ” i tagged along on maldonado ’ s first day back on the job recently . </s>  this was at jack d. weiler hospital , and 50 of his colleagues turned out for a surprise celebration . </s>  they cheered , clapped and shouted his name . </s>  he beamed . </s>  “ i feel even more than ever that this is what i should be doing , that this is my calling , ” he told me . </s>  “ maybe i got sick for a reason. ” one of his patients was a central american woman in her 30s with the coronavirus , fear radiating from her eyes . </s>  maldonado spoke to her in spanish , asking medical questions but also reassuring her and telling her about his own brush with the virus . </s>  “ you know , i was in the intensive care unit , ” he told her , adding teasingly , “ if i got better , you have to get better , too ! ” “ thank you , ” she said , “ for telling me that. ” • thanks to readers for generously donating to covid-19 relief through the five nonprofits i wrote

right hand . </s>  “ and i can tell you right now that painting went through me like a freight train , ” dr. driscoll recalled in 2019 . </s>  “ i don ’ t know if i was shaking on the outside , but i was shaking on the inside . </s>  i was mesmerized. ” he soon began craving more of that type of sensory experience , and he would go on to find it often in a career in art that included owning the venerable driscoll babcock galleries in manhattan and assembling a major collection of english studio pottery . </s>  he died on april 10 in peekskill , n.y. , at 70 . </s>  his death , which was not widely reported at the time , was caused by the new coronavirus , according to his wife , marylyn dintenfass , a painter . </s>  when dr. driscoll bought babcock galleries — on east 80th street near madison avenue — in 1987 , he had already held several curatorial jobs and been a partner in a boston gallery . </s>  at babcock — new york ’ s oldest gallery , having opened in 1852 — he widened its focus , combining historical and more recent work under one roof . </s>  where the gallery had specialized in early 20th-century art and the american modernism of artists like marsden hartley , he added 19th-century paintings , in particular landscapes by the hudson river school , as well as the work of post-world war ii artists . </s>  “ he was one of the first dealers who had come as a scholar from the museum world and one of the first to combine earlier historical art with more contemporary art , ” barbara haskell , a curator at the whitney museum of american art , said in an interview . </s>  dr. driscoll ’ s biography “ john frederick kensett : an american master ” ( 1985 ) — one of many books he wrote — helped establish him as a leading authority on that hudson river artist known for his luminist paintings . </s>  john paul driscoll was born on oct. 28 , 1949 , in madison , minn. , and grew up nearby in clarkfield , a farming village . </s>  his mother , vida ( loafman ) driscoll , owned dry cleaning shops , a cafe and a uniform store . </s>  his father , paul , was a high school teacher and coach . </s>  with his father ’ s encouragement , john hunted for

together without telling his parents. ” after earning a bachelor ’ s degree in history and art history at the university of minnesota , morris , dr. driscoll studied for a master ’ s in art history at penn state university , where he also earned a ph.d. in american art . </s>  his interest in collecting ceramics , in particular british pottery , began when he was a graduate assistant at the museum of art at penn state ( now the palmer museum of art ) . </s>  captivated by the pots , he found he could afford them even on his modest salary . </s>  paying from $ 4 to $ 80 for individual pieces , he bought works by significant contemporary potters like lucie rie , john ward , annette fuchs and hans coper . </s>  soon he traveled to england to visit potters , including ms. rie and mr. ward ,

washington crossing the delaware , ” from 1851 . </s>  a collector who had lent it to the white house for 35 years sold it to the founders of the minnesota marine art museum in winona . </s>  “ it ’ s probably the most famous american painting west of the hudson river , ” dr. driscoll said when it was unveiled . </s>  “ at auction , this picture would have pulled out not only art collectors but ultrapatriots who are very wealthy. ” after his death , mary burrichter , one of the museum ’ s founders , lauded his help as an adviser . </s>  “ we would get comments from guests like , ‘ this

stocks have fallen , entire industries are putting themselves on pause and all manner of small businesses are taking hits . </s>  there is so much we don ’ t know about what the next few months will bring , including whether it will even be over in the next few months . </s>  but the economic impact of the virus will be far-reaching , affecting everything from employment rates , to buyers ’ and agents ’ willingness to attend open houses , to whether sellers pull listings . </s>  many people will have less money , and they may have less access to it as well . </s>  quicken loans , the nation ’ s largest home-loan lender , said thursday that it had no current plans to change underwriting — which leaves open the possibility that it and others might in the future . </s>  all that may make it seem like an odd moment to consider buying a house . </s>  but there will be many people who are confident about their job security — or moving for job offers that haven ’ t evaporated . </s>  there will be others making room for new family members or looking to be closer to older ones who may need care . </s>  everyone needs someplace to live , and here is another thing that will probably not change : in many parts of the country ( and plenty of urban neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes ) , the housing stock for sale will be more attractive to many than what is for rent . </s>  much of the inventory has to come from people who are moving up or on and will themselves need to have the courage to buy themselves a new place . </s>  as of last month , elaine cicora and her husband ’ s year looked something like this : sell their macedonia , ohio , home later this spring ; buy a newly built one not far away and move in august ; withdraw money from retirement accounts in an orderly fashion if and when they need to ; and fly to austin this month to march their eldest daughter down the aisle . </s>  now , they ’ re putting their house on the market even sooner , in the hopes that they can catch buyers before they have second thoughts ; querying their builder about disrupted supply chains while considering what to do about the next deposit that is due on that place ; considering whether they ought to just call a halt to both buying and selling ; eyeing the markets with growing concern ; and close to canceling their texas plans . </s>  “ if it was only one or two of these things — stocks , out-of-state wedding , two house transactions — i wouldn ’ t be losing my mind , ” she said . </s>  many real estate shoppers were trying to weigh multiple moving pieces

</s>  had they waited a bit longer to move , they would have broken even thanks to rising real estate values there — but their new , bigger house would have cost that much more as well . </s>  they said this week that they had zero regrets about the 2008 purchase now that they are in what is likely their forever house , just over the city limits . </s>  their first home was a learning experience , mr. proman said . </s>  for example , they had focused on their own needs and not thought much about any eventual sale or the needs of their potential future buyers . </s>  all the stairs , they found , gave pause to older home shoppers . </s>  many people who are considering buying now may be swayed by other benefits of homeownership : control and certainty . </s>  you get a stable monthly housing payment — and rock-bottom interest rates might mean you never even have to refinance — plus the comfort of knowing the place is yours as long as you make that payment . </s>  that certainty has proved crucial for another minneapolis couple , lacey mamak and alison nowak . </s>  they scraped together a 3 percent down payment in 2008 ( in part through a local assistance program ) to buy an 800-square-foot house , and there they have stayed . </s>  they now have about $ 50,000 in equity and a mortgage payment of around $ 1,100 . </s>  back then , mx . </s>  mamak was in a part-time position but is now an academic librarian on the tenure track . </s>  ms. nowak is an adjunct instructor who also does design and communications work . </s>  rents in the area have risen so much that they believe they would have been priced out of town by now — or forced into different lines of work — if they had not bought . </s>  upon reflection this week , they were intensely dialed into the emotional resonance of home-ownership . </s>  first , there was gratitude for the fact that their fixed costs enable them to do work they love . </s>  then , there was empathy for people who need or want to move and are scared — this time for their health as much as their finances — and thus find themselves at the crossroads that the two of them were at 12 years ago . </s>  “ people tend to think of buying a house as a signifier of being an adult , and that if you can ’ t afford it , you ’ re somehow not an adult , ” mx . </s>  mamak said . </s>  “ but there are so many other factors and forces now , and it has nothing to do with your personal worth or how grown up you are . ” </s>    this obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  many americans seek professional reinvention as a way to animate their lives . </s>  for beryl bernay , her life was defined by it . </s>  ms. bernay — an actor , fashion designer , photographer , journalist , painter and amateur anthropologist — died on march 29 in manhattan . </s>  she was 94 . </s>  the cause was complications of the coronavirus , her niece , carol gonzalez , said . </s>  beryl bernstein was born on march 2 , 1926 , in brooklyn to russian émigré parents . </s>  her father , barney , who changed the family name to berney when she was a child , was a garment worker and her mother , sade berney , sold stockings and taught kindergarten . </s>  ( their daughter began spelling her name bernay in adulthood . ) </s>  she graduated from george washington high school in manhattan at 15 . </s>  too young to attend college , she worked at franklin simon & company as a draper and designer for teen and preteen fashions , ms. gonzalez said . </s>  she went on to attend pennsylvania state university . </s>  ms. bernay took acting classes with uta hagen and herbert berghof and appeared in several shows , including a 1955 production of thornton wilder ’ s “ the skin of our teeth ” in paris with helen hayes and mary martin . </s>  during her time in paris , she drove to the south of france to seek out pablo picasso and marc chagall , whom she captured in photographic portraits which she sent to harper ’ s weekly , along with an article , which published them . </s>  then there was a foray into children ’ s programming . </s>  between 1962 and 1965 , she was the creative force behind “ all join hands , ” a program produced by the united nations children ’ s fund in which she and her puppet co-hosts , miss bookworm and doodle the travel bug , narrated a show highlighting different countries . </s>  ms. bernay held a number of jobs at united nations agencies , often as a communications official . </s>  in those positions she frequently visited indonesia . </s>  “ beryl bernay was an astute observer of not only the political situation in indonesia , ” said wayne forrest , the president of the american indonesian chamber of commerce , “ she also had an abiding interest in the culture of bali , which she helped introduce to american audiences. ” in july of 1977 , she accompanied margaret mead , whom she had met in a class at columbia university , to work as her assistant on the anthropologist ’ s last field trip to the balinese mountain village of bayung gede . </s>  her photographs from that trip were displayed at the museum of natural history in new york . </s>  through it all , she also painted . </s>  ms. bernay ’ s two marriages ended in divorce . </s>  in 2011 , she told a reporter she was reluctant to give up any of her interests , all of which she dabbled in late into her life . </s>  “ i really enjoy each one of my things when i ’ m doing it , ” she said , “ and when i ’ m not doing it , i miss it . ” </s>    political conventions have been a balloons-and-bunting mainstay of american campaigns since the republican party gathered in baltimore to nominate henry clay for president in 1831 . </s>  but this year , they may join the list of crowded events — concerts , baseball games , movies and broadway shows — forced off the stage because of the coronavirus . </s>  and it may not matter . </s>  some democratic leaders are discussing replacing their convention with a virtual gathering , and some republicans are unsure about holding the big spectacle that president trump wants . </s>  yet even before the pandemic , a more fundamental debate was playing out : has the american political convention become a ritual holdover from another age ? </s>  for all the organizing , money , time and energy poured into a four-day extravaganza of parties , speeches , forums , lobbying and networking , there is a strong argument that they have become among the less consequential events on the political calendar . </s>  yes , candidates get their prime-time perch to speak to the nation . </s>  party delegates debate obscure bylaws and approve a platform that is likely to be forgotten the moment the final gavel is dropped . </s>  the events can provide a lift in the polls , but there is no shortage of convention nominees , john mccain and michael s. dukakis among them , who can attest to just how ephemeral that boost is . </s>  for all the talk of brokered conventions , it has been a long time since delegates had anything more to do than ratify a presidential candidate selected by primary voters and a running mate chosen by the nominee . </s>  as the drama has slipped away , so have the television networks , systematically cutting back on the hours of prime-time coverage devoted to events that have become little more than scripted advertisements . </s>  the parties themselves have become far less influential , particularly since mr. trump overcame the republican power structure to win the nomination in 2016 . </s>  they have been weakened by rising anti-establishment beliefs on the left and the right , notably among younger voters , and by the sentiment that parties are not as essential to ideas or governing anymore . </s>  the waning significance of conventions , long the grandest symbol of old-guard party-building , would appear to be of a piece . </s>  terry mcauliffe , the former governor of virginia who was the chairman of the 2000 democratic convention in los angeles , likened the conventions to a high school reunion . </s>  “ the party loves to get together , ” he said . </s>  but mr. mcauliffe said he was not particularly bothered by the possibility that democrats would not hold a convention in person this year to nominate former vice president joseph r. biden jr. “ listen , i ’ m a big lover of them , ” mr. mcauliffe said . </s>  “ but if we don ’ t have one , it ’ s going to be just fine . </s>  the real goal is introducing biden . </s>  there are a lot of creative ways to do it if we don ’ t have a convention. ” and in interviews with over a dozen emissaries and operatives from both parties , there was a strong view , especially among younger generations , that the value of conventions has flagged as the rules of politics have changed . </s>  “ our political memories have become so short that we can barely remember trump ’ s monthslong impeachment saga , let alone a weeklong infomercial for our party ’ s nominee , ” said zac petkanas , an aide on hillary clinton ’ s presidential campaign in 2016 . </s>  “ the dirty little secret of politics is that 80 percent of what everyone thinks is important in campaigns doesn ’ t matter one little bit. ” he said that any obsession with conventions reflected a “ 1990s perspective ” divorced from trump-era news velocity . </s>  kevin madden , who was a senior adviser to mitt romney , the republican nominee for president in 2012 , recalled that the party ’ s convention that year produced just one enduring scene : a curious , semi-scripted bit from the actor clint eastwood , who conversed onstage with an empty chair . </s>  “ they spend a year developing , it ’ ll take an hour to execute , and right afterward the effect will already be going through its life cycle , ” mr. madden said of the modern convention , “ and disappearing into another chaotic media environment. ” there is certainly a constituency for this kind of american tradition , particularly among political leaders who have spent a lifetime attending these quadrennial gatherings . </s>  “ i ’ m the old-fashioned guy here , ” said walter f. mondale , the former democratic vice president who was nominated to run for president at the party ’ s 1984 convention in san francisco . </s>  “ i have always liked political conventions : the consultations , the debates , the votes , the roll-calls and other things . </s>  i ’ ve lived with it my whole life and i ’ ve liked it. ” “ i don ’ t know what the alternative is , ” he said . </s>  jennifer palmieri , who was a senior aide to president barack obama and to mrs. clinton , the democratic candidate nominated to succeed him in 2016 , said she had come to see the prime-time speeches from party nominees as meaningful moments , “ not just for the candidate but for the country. ” “ it ’ s the organizing principle for the campaign , a kickoff to the fall , a way for the ticket to present a comprehensive articulation of how they would govern , ” she said of conventions . </s>  russell j. schriefer , the republican consultant who was the program manager for the republican conventions in 2004 and 2012 , said these gatherings served a purpose , though perhaps not as critical a purpose as they once did . </s>  “ despite the fact that we ’ re not selecting our nominees there anymore , they can act as a final stopgap if a nomination is in question , and it can go to the floor , ” he said . </s>  “ those rules still exist . </s>  it just hasn ’ t happened for a long time. ” mr. dukakis , a former governor of massachusetts , said he thought the 1988 democratic convention where he was nominated had helped him — but not for long . </s>  “ we were great coming out of it , ” he said . </s>  “ i think i had some pretty significant momentum coming out of it and kind of screwed it up . </s>  is it helpful if it ’ s a successful convention ? </s>  yes , it ’ s a plus. ” conventions have certainly provided memorable moments . </s>  the appearance of mr. obama , then a u.s. senate candidate from illinois , at the 2004 convention in boston put him on a path to the white house . </s>  the 1984 “ shining city upon a hill ” speech by mario m. cuomo , the democratic governor of new york , defined his legacy as much as anything he ever did as governor . </s>  but those were hardly recent . </s>  and if a principal purpose of conventions has been the projection of party unity after a fractious primary race , recent history has been checkered — and heavy on conspicuous booing . </s>  in 2016 , supporters of mr. trump jeered senator ted cruz , the texas republican and his chief rival in the republican primaries , who pointedly declined to endorse mr. trump from the convention stage , urging attendees to “ vote your conscience ” in november . </s>  on the democratic side , delegates of senator bernie sanders of vermont repeatedly heckled party officials , admirers of mrs. clinton and even mr. sanders himself when he asked his supporters to back her . </s>  asked whether the democratic convention was ultimately helpful to mrs. clinton , leah daughtry , the event ’ s chief executive , paused . </s>  “ i think so , ” she said . </s>  “ when the balloons are dropping and the nominee is out onstage , there ’ s a certain amount of closure . </s>  of course , there were those for whom that was not a satisfactory outcome . </s>  i don ’ t know that anything would have been a satisfactory outcome. ” mindful of the loyal passion of sanders voters , some biden allies have wondered in recent weeks if a scaled-down virtual convention might at least deliver a silver lining : fewer opportunities for the vermont senator ’ s supporters to register their disappointment in open view . </s>  of course , things could have been more complicated . </s>  gary w. hart , the former colorado senator who twice ran unsuccessfully for the democratic presidential nomination , suggested the party was fortunate that the race had clarified itself — mr. biden took command in early march — before the pandemic upended the campaign . </s>  “ i don ’ t know how they would have done it , ” mr. hart said of a socially distanced contested convention . </s>  “ a big zoom. ” whatever mr. trump has in mind for this summer , party leaders have begun weighing the ramifications of a partisan convention divide : the possibility of a republican convention in charlotte , in person as planned , and a democratic convention held remotely — consistent with a higher regard for public health warnings among democrats . </s>  for all that , the romantic attachment to conventions endures , a place for party members to reconnect with old friends or fight old fights , be quoted in their local newspapers or booked onto “ this week with george stephanopoulos , ” or just to feast on four days of open bars and buffet tables . </s>  “ i ’ m a fan of in-person conventions — i may be one of the few left , ” said barbara l. boxer , a former california senator who said she had attended every democratic convention since 1984 . </s>  “ look , i like to go shopping in a retail store , too . </s>  what ’ s going to happen to that ? </s>  when you get used to certain things , they have a certain place in your heart .

german authorities made a nationwide appeal : more safety masks were urgently needed . </s>  at melitta , the company that pioneered the paper coffee filter , inspiration was close at hand . </s>  “ the ergonomics of the thing , the fact that the filter fits exactly over mouth , nose and chin is so unbelievable that you might call it a gift from heaven , ” katharina roehrig , a managing director at melitta , which is based in a small city in northwestern germany . </s>  melitta has a 112-year history with coffee filters that began in the kitchen of the woman who invented them , melitta bentz . </s>  the company also owns wolf pvg , which has produced air filters and vacuum-cleaner bags for decades , providing valuable knowledge and a supply of the three-ply microfiber needed to make masks to a hospital standard . </s>  “ facing this particular challenge , we realized that we could produce the needed quantities at an insane speed , ” said ms. roehrig . </s>  in other words , as much as a million masks a day . </s>  “ that is what differentiates us from the competition , ” she said . </s>  as germany scrambles to find enough face masks to reopen the economy and public life while keeping the coronavirus at bay , a number of serious and not-so-serious businesses have jumped into the fray with masks . </s>  they have tried to produce and sell the bizarre ( masks made from bras ) , the unexpected ( the playmobil mask ) , the hip ( an upcycled cotton mask by a berlin designer ) and the customizable ( why not advertise while protecting yourself ? ) . </s>  but as chancellor angela merkel has frequently acknowledged , the crucial problem is ensuring that germans have a sufficient number of quality masks . </s>  “ the pandemic teaches us that it is not good if protective equipment is sourced exclusively from distant countries , ” ms. merkel told parliament . </s>  “ masks that cost a few cents can become a strategic factor in a pandemic. ” the minister of economy , peter altmaier , estimated that the country needs up to 12 billion masks a year . </s>  many masks that filter small particles using microfiber rely on material whose production has mostly moved to asia . </s>  in the mad rush to secure the raw materials , politicians and businesspeople have made it their business to find a source . </s>  “ it ’ s been a long time since the textile materials sector has gotten so much attention , ” said dr. david schmelzeisen , a textile engineer who runs need-mask.com , which connects suppliers with customers . </s>  the essential ingredient in many medical-grade masks — what separates them from simple home made versions — is a filter made of nonwoven super thin fibers , formed in a process known as melt-blown extrusion . </s>  since the pandemic

factory in spenge 30 miles to minden , where melitta has been based since its founding in 1908 . </s>  ( melitta also makes coffee filters in the united states , but not face masks . ) </s>  the coffee-filter-shaped masks are produced on the same machine as the filters found in grocery store aisles . </s>  although they physically resemble a normal coffee filter , the masks are made from different material ( making them unsuitable for brewing coffee ) . </s>  the material , a triple layer of melt-blown and spun-blown microfiber , has a bacterial filtration efficiency certification of above 98 percent , a value comparable to simple medical masks . </s>  the company has now produced about 10 million masks over the first month , packing them in unmarked boxes , with separate rubber bands to hold the masks in place and assembly instructions . </s>  the first million went to melitta workers and retirees and their families . </s>  most of the second million have already been donated locally . </s>  once the mask is approved by the government as a medical product , the company plans to supply those most in need in their region , and eventually sell the product to a broader market . </s>  the company has not yet announced a price . </s>  “ what is important for us is that we can supply quality masks produced in germany at prices that are competitive with masks produced in asia before the pandemic , ” said rené korte , who oversaw the retooling of one of the coffee-filter lines at melitta . </s>  mr. korte and his team are working on designs with foldout ear-loops , eliminating the need for rubber bands . </s>  this initiative is not the first time melitta has considered getting into the face mask business . </s>  about a decade ago , it looked into manufacturing masks because the process fit with the company ’ s expertise . </s>  but this was before the coronavirus . </s>  “ the idea that the shape of filter bags for breathing masks could serve as a model was absurd to many , ” mr. korte said . </s>  “ the production of breathing masks was then still a niche topic for us , and was therefore rejected . ” </s>    ( want to get this briefing by email ? </s>

care and income inequality . </s>  news analysis : “ despite mr. biden ’ s success during the last two weeks of primaries , he will need to make gains with some key sanders constituencies — not only younger liberals but also latinos across several age brackets — to build the most formidable coalition possible , ” our reporters write . </s>  “ he will almost certainly need mr. sanders ’ s help to get there. ” the details : if mr. sanders were to have any chance at winning a majority of delegates before the democratic convention , he would need to perform much better than he has so far . </s>  here are some possible outcomes for the remaining primaries . </s>  another angle : president trump ’ s re-election campaign was counting on a strong economy and an opponent in mr. sanders , who is

the loss of ideals , in tiananmen square in 1989 , when chinese tanks and soldiers crushed a monthslong protest in beijing calling for democratic changes to china ’ s one-party rule . </s>  this year , for the first time , hong kong will not have the chance to officially remember an event it can not forget . </s>  the annual vigil was banned by the territory ’ s authorities , who said they were trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus . </s>  but the outlawing of the commemoration for the only time in three decades comes when hong kong has been experiencing its own months of often-violent protests . </s>  and it follows by only a few days a move by the chinese communist party to approve a new law that will allow for the suppression of what it considers subversion , secession and seemingly any acts that might threaten national security in the semiautonomous city . </s>  the ban on the vigil also arrives as china is trying to take advantage of the current chaos in the united states . </s>  its goal is both to spread its influence globally and to tighten the internal grip of its authoritarian leader , president xi jinping . </s>  in early 1989 , change seemed in the air . </s>  the soviet union was wobbling , and its iron curtain across eastern europe was beginning to show signs of cracking . </s>  that spring , many hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters — at first , mostly students , then a wide cross section of beijing workers — gathered in tiananmen square in the capital . </s>  with the protests applying intense pressure to the country ’ s leadership , and with the eyes of the world watching with mostly hopeful anticipation , the demonstrators ’ calls for democracy appeared poised to be realized . </s>  then , early in the morning of june 4 , the chinese government decided it would act , but not to meet protesters ’ demands . </s>  instead , it ordered the military to clear the square , killing hundreds , maybe thousands of protesters . </s>  the memory of that massacre has faded , or at least lost its urgency , in much of the world . </s>  but not in hong kong . </s>  the day after the crackdown produced one of the most indelible images in the history of visual journalism : a lone man in a white shirt standing in the way of four tanks . </s>  at the hong kong vigils that followed , though , it was another iconic image from tiananmen square , this one more hopeful , that was often highly visible — the 10-meter-tall goddess of democracy , inspired by the statue of liberty , which had stood over the beijing protesters and was smashed in the crackdown . </s>  year after year , the vigils in hong kong drew enormous crowds . </s>  those attending were not only commemorating the deaths in beijing but embodying the rights given them for 50 years in the 1997 handover agreement between britain and china — freedom of assembly and a free press — which had always seemed fragile with an authoritarian giant next door . </s>  last year ’ s vigil was both particularly large and extra poignant ; it came less than three months after the introduction of a bill in hong kong ’ s legislature that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to china . </s>  that bill , since withdrawn , incited the protests that have swept hong kong . </s>  those protests , which raged last year , were largely curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic and the social distancing rules put in place to combat it . </s>  hong kong in recent weeks has been emerging from its lockdown relatively unscathed , with only four reported deaths . </s>  the expectations were that the protests would pick up again . </s>  but the threat posed by the new security law , which was condemned by the trump administration , seems to have achieved one of its goals of diminishing the size and potency of the protests . </s>  the banning of this year ’ s tiananmen vigil underscored that hong kong ’ s freedoms are entering an uncertain phase . </s>    this was supposed to be a big year for the trisha brown dance company , founded 50 years ago . </s>  in early march , the troupe flew to france to begin a sold-out anniversary tour . </s>  the first few shows went great . </s>  then came the wave of coronavirus cancellations , and the dancers found themselves on the last american airlines flight from paris to new york . </s>  scattered across the country — or in one case , back home in australia — the dancers did what separated groups of every kind are doing : they met up virtually . </s>  they checked in on one another , commiserated about the canceled shows and started floating ideas about how they might continue to work remotely . </s>  one option quickly rose to the top : “ roof piece. ” “ roof piece ” is a work that brown , who died in 2017 , first performed in 1971 . </s>  she and some colleagues scattered themselves across the water-tower-capped roofs of soho and played a dance version of the game telephone . </s>  one dancer executed a series of semaphore-like movements , which the dancer on the next roof over tried to copy exactly , and so on down the line . </s>  spectators , stationed atop buildings , could follow the transmission and the errors , the inevitable decay in the signal that brown intended the exercise to expose . </s>  people who didn ’ t know what was going on might also take notice , and that was part of the plan , too . </s>  that ’ s why the dancers all wore red . </s>  like many of brown ’ s early works — for example , “ man walking down the side of a building ” — “ roof piece ” is both simple and radical . </s>  brainstorming about how to reproduce it virtually , the dancers immediately ran into a snag : not everyone had access to a roof . </s>  so they decided that a roof wasn ’ t essential to the piece ; communication across distances was . </s>  the original “ roof piece ” was inspired by the follow-the-leader copying in dance classes and rehearsals , a mode of transmission fundamental to how dancers learn . </s>  with all the dance and yoga instruction proliferating online now — all that imitation via screens — a virtual “ roof piece ” seems right for the moment . </s>  what ’ s more , as the company dancer jamie scott said , doing “ roof piece ” inside felt “ like a nod of solidarity to people who are also confined. ” so that ’ s what the troupe did , recording the result , now called “ room/roof piece , ” and polishing it with some editing before posting the video on social media . </s>  in another nod of solidarity , the company now encourages people at home to try their own virtual “ room/roof piece. ” first , invite some friends to a meeting on a videoconferencing platform . </s>  ( the dancers used zoom . ) </s>  then choose the order of transmission : who is leader , who is no . </s>  2 , no . </s>  3 and so on . </s>  the leader starts with a simple greeting , a wave of the hand . </s>  the rest of the motions are up to you , whatever you think “ semaphore-like ” means . </s>  ( “ joint articulation and parallel and perpendicular lines , ” brown further specified . ) </s>  a deep squat is the signal for the last person in line to take over as leader , reversing the flow . </s>  when that new leader wants it all to end , another squat is the sign . </s>  figuring out how to make this all work on zoom took the brown dancers some trial and error . </s>  in the rooftop version , everyone faces one direction , each copying the back of the person ahead . </s>  in the online version , everyone must face the screen . </s>  “ we have to do the opposite of what we ’ re seeing for the transmission to look right , ” the dancer amanda kmett ’ pendry said . </s>  the online version required some new choreography , so to speak . </s>  for the transmission to flow in sequence when viewers watch the dancers in a tile arrangement , the dancers have to turn on their cameras in the right order . </s>  for a dancer to see only the one person “ in front , ” each participant has to push a button at the right time . </s>  ( on zoom , this involves the “ pin ” function . ) </s>  the dancers tried hard to maintain the integrity of the original — they wear as much red as they had with them — but the online version is inevitably different , for participants and viewers . </s>  on rooftops , the distance between buildings , or obstructions like ledges , impair perfect mirroring . </s>  online , it can be a briefly frozen signal , a difference in camera angle or maybe a naughty cat . </s>  outside , a viewer can see only a part of the line and has to imagine that the signal started somewhere unseen or continues out of sight . </s>  someone watching online can track the whole sequence , rather like a guard keeping an eye on isolated prisoners via a bank of surveillance cameras . </s>  outside , “ you really see the audience , ” said carolyn lucas , the company ’ s associate artistic director . </s>  “ they ’ re in close proximity , and they connect with the work so closely . </s>  but here we are in this place where , my god , there ’ s no close proximity . </s>  yet there ’ s a determination to find a vehicle to counteract the distance. ” as ms. lucas noted , that determination is strongest among the dancers . </s>  “ even though the technology scares me a little , there ’ s this whole crew of younger dancers who are eager to figure out how to adapt. ” it ’ s a situation common to many companies right now . </s>  as a steward of brown ’ s legacy , ms. lucas welcomes the generational shift . </s>  the online versions “ aren ’ t the same , but that ’ s ok , ” she said , “ the fun of trisha ’ s work is that there ’ s always something to investigate and figure out. ” general “ roof piece ” guidelines still apply . </s>  “ keep moving even if you ’ re not sure what you ’ re seeing , ” ms. kmett ’ pendry advised . </s>  simultaneously receiving and transmitting the message is the idea . </s>  “ don ’ t judge what you ’ re seeing . </s>  make the best guess and pass that on. ” “ you don ’ t have to be too fancy , ” ms. lucas said . </s>  “ you should feel really comfortable with the movement that comes out of you. ” the brown dancers are experts , practiced in mimicry , who share a common style of supple yet articulate motion . </s>  but even with them , you can see how the same movement changes as it transfers from body to body , mind to mind . </s>  “ everybody ’ s idiosyncratic movement preference is going to be exposed in this , and that ’ s something people can celebrate , ” ms. lucas said . </s>  in the end , the videoconferencing “ roof piece ” is an exercise in how to communicate with people far away . </s>  it ’ s about how patrick mcgrath in santa monica , calif. , can send a physical message through a digital image to eight fellow dancers who include stuart shugg in australia and jacob storer in richland center , wis. it ’ s about how cecily campbell , in santa fe , can see mr. storer move , and hear the birds near him , and indicate that she ’ s received mr. mcgrath ’ s round-the-world message by mimicking it and adding an appreciative smile . </s>  if you film yourself and your friends doing “ room/roof piece , ” post a link to your video in the comments ( twitter or instagram work best ) ,

bad news . </s>  the federal reserve unveiled a vast expansion of its efforts to shore up businesses and keep markets functioning . </s>  but the brief boost for wall street was soon wiped away as washington lawmakers failed again to come together on a nearly $ 2 trillion rescue package . </s>  across the landscape of american business , grim news abounded monday as the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed the country . </s>  boeing said it was temporarily idling 70,000 factory workers in washington state after about 30 employees tested positive for covid-19 . </s>  twitter said its revenue would take a hit as advertising has declined . </s>  nordstrom , its cash diminished , drew down $ 800 million in credit . </s>  and general electric said it would cut 10 percent of workers in its aviation unit . </s>  the biggest factor again driving markets was congress , which hit another wall in its attempt to push through a fiscal stimulus package . </s>  senate democrats blocked the progress of the nearly $ 2 trillion government rescue package for a second time as they continued to negotiate for stronger protections for workers and restrictions for bailed-out businesses . </s>  the s & p 500 fell about 3 percent monday , adding to a 15 percent plunge last week as traders remained cautious about the fed ’ s ability to shift the trajectory of an economy that appears to be in free-fall because of the coronavirus crisis . </s>  “ it is hard for the fed to stimulate underlying demand . </s>  for that , fiscal stimulus is needed , ” randy watts , chief investment strategist at william o ’ neil , an equity research and advisory firm , wrote in an email . </s>  “ the deal in the senate of the fiscal stimulus bill is obviously disappointing. ” there was more reason to worry on monday as well . </s>  the international monetary fund ’ s managing director , kristalina georgieva , said she expected “ a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse ” this year , with a rebound in 2021 . </s>  “ the faster the virus stops , the quicker and stronger the recovery will be , ” she added . </s>  and forecasters at morgan stanley offered one of the grimmest assessments for how much damage the coronavirus could inflict on the american economy in the months to come . </s>  the economists said in a research note that they expected the economy to contract at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the first quarter of the year and a 30 percent rate in the second quarter — which would be the worst single-quarter drop recorded in modern american economic statistics . </s>  in that scenario , the unemployment rate would approach 13 percent , which would also be a record . </s>  “ economic activity has come to a near standstill in march , ” they wrote . </s>  still , investors signaled a possible reprieve from market slumps . </s>  asian markets opened broadly higher on tuesday , led by a nearly 6 percent rise in japanese stocks . </s>  futures markets predicted wall street would open higher as well . </s>  as fox news played down the coronavirus , its chief protected himself . </s>  in the first 10 days of march , some of the commentators on fox news and fox business played down the threat of what would soon be recognized as a pandemic . </s>  many of the networks ’ elderly , pro-trump viewers responded to the coverage and the president ’ s public statements by taking the virus less seriously than others . </s>  but one elderly fox news viewer , a crucial supporter of president trump , took the threat seriously : the channel ’ s chairman , rupert murdoch , who was to celebrate his 89th birthday on march 11 . </s>  on march 8 , as the virus was spreading , the murdoch family called off a planned party out of concern for the patriarch ’ s health , according to a person familiar with the cancellation . </s>  there were about 20 people on the guest list . </s>  the canceled party is perhaps the most glaring

support those participating in our stem-writing contest , in which students are invited to choose an issue or question in science , technology , engineering , math or health that interests them , then write a 500-word explanation that will engage and enlighten readers . </s>  for even more on how to help your students write interesting , clear and meaningful informational pieces , please see our related writing unit . </s>  overview our stem-writing contest asks students to include three elements — an engaging opening ; quotes from experts or research ; and a section that explains why the topic they ’ ve chosen matters . </s>  to help students think about that last element , we pose these questions : why do you care — and why should we care ? </s>  whom or what does your topic affect ? </s>  how is it relevant to broader questions in the field , to the world today and to our own lives ? </s>  most informational journalism explicitly addresses those questions . </s>  a recent piece about the coronavirus , for instance , begins with a story about a sick chinese man who hasn ’ t been able to get even basic care at a local hospital . </s>  then the story pulls back and gives us this context : as it struggles to combat a coronavirus outbreak that has sickened more than 4,500 people and killed 106 , the chinese government is relying on a medical system that is overburdened and overwhelmed even in normal times . </s>  while other parts of everyday life in china have significantly improved in the past decade , the quality of health care has stagnated . </s>  but even in articles about less serious topics , you ’ ll still find such a section . </s>  let ’ s say , for instance , you ’ re a journalist writing about what it ’ s like to be friends with a social-media influencer . </s>  at some point you will have to explain the significance of the topic and why it is worth your readers ’ time . </s>  to see what we mean , take a look at “ will you be my # content ? </s>  , ” a 2020 style article about social media influencers and oversharers , and the friends who don ’ t necessarily want to be co-stars . </s>  as you read , try to put your finger on the paragraph or paragraphs in which the writer explains to you why this topic matters now , and what questions it raises about our world . </s>  when you ’ re finished , if you ’ re doing this in a classroom setting , you might share the paragraph or paragraphs you chose with others . </s>  here is the paragraph we chose , which comes right after the opening story about ellen wright and her friends : with the rise of nano-influencers , more and more everyday people are turning their personal lives into full-time careers . </s>  and that raises important questions regarding the people who populate those personal lives : what expectations of privacy do friends and partners have a right to when hanging out with someone whose job or hobby it is to share everything about their day-to-day ? </s>  where do we draw the line between self-expression and unwarranted exposure ? </s>  this is what journalists call the “ nut graf , ” shorthand for “ nutshell paragraph , ” because it explains the context of a topic and gives you , more or less , the essence of the story . </s>  it often follows the “ lead , ” or opening paragraph or paragraphs that attempt to get your attention . </s>  poynter , a global journalism institute , explains it as when the writer “ backs up to provide context for the scene in the lead , like a filmmaker drawing back from a close-up to a wide-angle shot , ” writing : this is the “ nut section , ” that provides the background by addressing “ how ? ” and “ why ? ” the scene described in the lead came to be . </s>  without context , the reader who is hooked by an arresting lead may feel left dangling . </s>  in this edition of our mentor text series , you ’ ll both learn more about how these paragraphs work and try to write your own . </s>  before you read are you hooked on your smartphone ? </s>  how much time do you spend looking at it every day ? </s>  what would it be like if you had to go a full day without it ? </s>  you ’ re about to read a piece full of tips and ideas on this subject . </s>  before you do , try to write a “ nut ” paragraph about why the topic of being “ hooked on our smartphone ” matters in our world today . </s>  why is it a problem now ? </s>  what effects is it having on us personally , and on our society at large ? </s>  why should we learn about how to deal with this issue ? </s>  mentor texts : the personal health column now that you ’ ve written your own “ nut graf ” on the topic , take a look at “ hooked on our smartphones ” and see if you can locate the place where jane brody , the author , moves “ from a close-up to a wide-angle shot ” and does what we just asked you to do . </s>  she begins the piece by quoting lin-manuel miranda and describing a number of common scenarios in which looking at a smartphone hijacks our attention . </s>  but with the paragraph that begins , “ observations like these have prompted a new york psychotherapist to ask , ‘ what really matters ? ’ in life , ” the author begins to give us a broader context for these observations . </s>  then she writes : the near-universal access to digital technology , starting at ever younger ages , is transforming modern society in ways that can have negative effects on physical and mental health , neurological development and personal relationships , not to mention safety on our roads and sidewalks . </s>  if you notice , that paragraph is really just one long sentence that quickly lists the surprisingly broad range of ways that digital technology is having negative effects on us . </s>  ms. brody has written the times ’ s personal health column since 1976 , so you have many useful examples to choose from if you scroll through it . </s>  pick a few that are especially interesting to you , then read them to see if you can find a paragraph or paragraphs that perform this “ in a nutshell ” function . </s>  for instance you might read : “ how to ‘ winterize ’ your dog ” “ looking on the bright side may be good for your health ” “ for real weight control , try portion control ” “ managing teenage acne ” “ the crisis in youth suicide ” and if you did , you might identify paragraphs like the ones below as good examples of places where the author zooms out and shows you why the topic matters . </s>  from “ how to ‘ winterize ’ your dog , ” a paragraph that is not about practical ways to do this , but about why you should do it in the first place : whether urban or rural , dogs can face multiple hazards during the colder months , ranging from cracked paws and dry skin to electrocution or immersion in a frozen pond . </s>  from “ looking on the bright side may be good for your health , ” a section that explains why this information might literally help extend your life : an increasing number of recent long-term studies has linked greater optimism to a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and other chronic ailments and to fostering “ exceptional longevity , ” a category one team of researchers used for people who live to 85 and beyond . </s>  from “ for real weight control , try portion control , ” a brief explanation for why this way of eating is better than the many , many diet fads the reader is probably already familiar with : unlike the myriad diet fads that have yet to stem the ever-increasing girth of american men and women , what dr. young describes is not a diet but a practical approach to food and eating that can be adapted to almost any way of life , even if most meals are eaten out or taken out . </s>  it is not prescriptive or even proscriptive . </s>  it does not cut out any category of food , like carbohydrates or fats , nor does it deprive people of their favorite foods , including sweet treats . </s>  from “ is your sleep cycle out of sync ? </s>  it may be genetic , ” a paragraph that follows a story about an early-riser friend , but segues into research that shows many others also suffer from this problem : and , it seems , her early-to-sleep , early-to-wake rhythm may not be as extremely rare as has long been believed . </s>  in a new study in the journal sleep by researchers in san francisco , salt lake city and madison , wis. , of more than 2,400 patients who visited a sleep clinic for complaints like sleep apnea or insomnia , a small number of them were found to have a previously unrecognized familial form of advanced sleep phase , a kind of permanent jet lag that the study showed often runs in families . </s>  from “ managing teenage acne , ” a paragraph that puts the problem in context — being a teenager is hard , and having acne makes it even harder : the teenage years are challenging times for many youngsters even under the best of circumstances . </s>  but if the face they present to the world is marred by prominent lesions of acne , the ordinary emotional and social stresses of adolescence can be that much more difficult to weather . </s>  from “ the crisis in youth suicide , ” statistics that show that this is a crisis we should care about : in october , the centers for disease control and prevention reported that after a stable period from 2000 to 2007 , the rate of suicide among those aged 10 to 24 increased dramatically — by 56 percent — between 2007 and 2017 , making suicide the second leading cause of death in this age group , following accidents like car crashes . </s>  now try this : step back from whatever topic you ’ re writing about and focus on why it is important . </s>  try answering these questions first so that when you get to the point in your piece where you might include a kind of “ nut ” paragraph of your own , you ’ re prepared with ideas : why is this topic worth writing about ? </s>  what is the wider context for this ? </s>  why might it help to explain to show why this is an important topic ? </s>  how is it relevant in the world today ? </s>  whom or what does it affect ? </s>  why ? </s>  how ? </s>  how is it relevant to broader questions in the field ? </s>  finally , take a look at this edition of our “ annotated by the author ” series , in which the times international climate reporter , somini sengupta , shows you where , why and how she included “ why-it-matters ” paragraphs in her piece “ these five cuisines are easier on the planet. ” what can you learn from her choices ? </s>    stocks in the united states suffered their worst decline since early october , amid concern that a dangerous new virus could hurt the global economy . </s>  on wall street , the s & p 500 and the nasdaq composite index both dropped 0.9 percent on friday . </s>  the declines picked up steam after officials said a second case of the virus , the coronavirus , had been diagnosed in the united states . </s>  the patient , a woman in her 60s in chicago , had recently traveled to wuhan , china , the center of the outbreak . </s>  earlier friday , the chinese authorities broadened a travel lockdown in central china to 12 cities near wuhan . </s>  the orders effectively pen in 35 million residents to try to contain the virus , which had led to at least 41 deaths by friday evening and more than 1,000 infections worldwide . </s>  airline shares — exposed to the impact of travel restrictions related to the virus — dropped sharply , american airlines by 4 percent and united airlines by 3.5 percent . </s>  the news also battered shares of companies with significant exposure to the chinese market . </s>  shares of the casino company wynn resorts , which is heavily reliant on revenue from chinese gamblers in macau , fell more than 3 percent . </s>  commodities markets also reflected a downbeat view of the outlook for global growth on friday , with prices for oil and copper falling . </s>  energy and materials stocks also slumped during friday ’

lending in recent days . </s>  huntington bancshares fell 3.8 percent , while keycorp and regions financial both fell more than 2.5 percent . </s>  jpmorgan chase fell 2.5 percent . </s>  the stumble in financial stocks mirrored a sharp drop in bond yields , which serve as the foundation for commercial lending rates and can have an impact on the profitability of loans . </s>  the yield on the

strong growth in sales of chips for data centers . </s>  intel ’ s shares rose more than 8 percent . </s>  before the start of trading on friday , american express reported better-than-expected profits and provided an optimistic outlook for results in 2020 . </s>  its shares rose 2.8 percent . </s>  at times , friday ’ s sell-off was a steeper slide than investors had experienced in a while , with stocks down more than 1.2 percent at some points in the afternoon . </s>  had the s & p 500 closed at that level , the decline would have been the index ’ s first of more than 1 percent since oct. 8 , when a flare-up of tensions between the united states and china sent shares down 1.6 percent . </s>  ultimately , the market pared back some of its deepest losses before the close of trading . </s>  even after the drop , the s & p 500 remains up 2 percent in january , a strong start after the market ’ s 28.9 percent rise in 2019 . </s>    the australia letter is a weekly newsletter from our australia bureau . </s>  sign up to get it by email . </s>  this week ’ s issue is written by besha rodell , a columnist for the australia bureau . </s>  when i left my five-year post as restaurant critic for la weekly in 2017 to move back to australia , the final review i filed was for a restaurant called vespertine , an immersive experience in a multistory glass building that is as much performance art as it is restaurant . </s>  that description might sound familiar to anyone who read my australia fare column this week , a review of the d ’ arenberg cube in mclaren vale , south australia . </s>  i thought a lot about vespertine while considering the d ’ arenberg cube . </s>  the two restaurants have many similarities : they both are inspired by — and in fact inseparable from — the architecture of the buildings they are in , and they both invite us to experience dinner ( or , in the case of the d ’ arenberg cube , lunch ) as far more than a meal . </s>  vespertine ’ s most notable flaw is undoubtedly its rigid self-seriousness . </s>  atonal music grinds while unsmiling waiters wearing dark-colored sacks deliver preposterous dishes , giving no hint that they understand the absurdity of the setting and situation . </s>  the d ’ arenberg cube , on the other hand , revels in its own silliness and sense of fun . </s>  and it challenges the diner to give in to that joyous folly , or risk wasting $ 210 and a few hours on a meal ( and an experience ) that is as ridiculous as it is delicious . </s>  as i point out in my review of the cube , the restaurant succeeds in large part because of that ridiculousness , not in spite of it . </s>  i also quoted a neighboring winemaker as saying that the cube would be unbearable if it weren ’ t “ kind of daggy. ” daggy is one of those words that , during my quarter-century living in the united states , were difficult to explain to american friends . </s>  uncool but lovable ? </s>  a little bit shabby but in a human , endearing way ? </s>  ( i recognize that the word conveys slightly varied levels of distain , depending on geography and the social class of the user , but in melbourne ’ s northern suburbs — where i grew up — it had a decidedly affectionate connotation . ) </s>  in my opinion , dagginess is one of australia ’ s defining strengths . </s>  it is certainly a huge part of who i am , and that fact made life in america hard on me at times . </s>  the pressure to be perfect in american culture is real , and i was never interested in conforming to that aspiration . </s>  my house was messy , my clothes were from the op shop ( or thrift store , as they ’ re known there ) , my yard was overgrown and besmirched by a ( gasp ! ) </s>  clothesline . </s>  those things often stood in the way of friendships in america . </s>  i ’ m glad to be back in australia , where it is understood that even if you spend $ 17 million on something , it might still turn out daggy — and could be all the better for that ineffable , ridiculous quality . </s>  what other australian words and qualities do you find difficult to describe to non-australians ? </s>  tell us at nytaustralia @ nytimes.com .

them with flattery . </s>  “ there are still young people in china without cellphone or internet connection , ” a viewer wrote on bilibili , the video website that made the commercial , in a comment

out across the chinese internet over the past week amounts to a debate about the future of the world ’ s other superpower — specifically , for the minds and the souls of china ’ s younger generation .

tensions to the fore . </s>  every society has its generational differences , but in china they are stark . </s>  china ’ s boomers , who were born in the 1960s and 1970s , are as lucky as the

production act to battle the coronavirus pandemic , but his advisers have resisted making aggressive use of the law to mobilize private industry . </s>  mr. trump has given mixed signals about whether his administration has actually used the law at all to spur the production of scarce and necessary items like ventilators ; testing kits ; and protective masks , gloves , and gowns . </s>  here is an explanation of the law . </s>  what is the defense production act ? </s>  it is a law that permits the federal government to impose some control over private-sector industry to ensure the production of material that is deemed necessary for national defense . </s>  it traces back to the korean war . </s>  congress enacted it with military necessities like steel and tanks in mind , but lawmakers expanded it after the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks to cover other areas , including public health and safety . </s>  it was reauthorized last year until 2025 . </s>  notably , an existing government panel created under the law , the defense production act committee — made up of officials from various agencies — already has a process and a system in place to implement it . </s>  “ if i were advising the president , i would say , ‘ mr . </s>  president you have a lot more tools available under the d.p.a . </s>  than are being used . </s>  moreover , some of the tools have lead times , ’ ” said jamie e. baker , a former legal adviser to the national security council and a professor of national security law at syracuse university . </s>  he added : “ and , if these tools are being used , then the government should be more transparent in their use so that the public and our first responders are aware that help is on the way. ” how could the law force companies to prioritize making certain items ? </s>  one part of the law permits the government to alter the order in which companies fulfill their contractual obligations by telling them to prioritize some existing contracts ahead of others . </s>  for example , if a company makes surgical masks and other paper products , the government could tell it to put the other items on hold to free up production for masks . </s>  the pentagon routinely uses this authority with defense contractors . </s>  there is an open question about whether the government could use the law to force a company to accept a new contract for a product that it does not already make . </s>  convincing companies to set up new facilities from scratch may be particularly difficult . </s>  industry executives said it could take months for factories to obtain the necessary equipment to begin production . </s>  much of the equipment used in american factories is now made offshore , and the global shipping industry is in disarray . </s>

could the law affect allocation of medical items ? </s>  the law gives the federal government the power to decide how scarce material of national security importance is distributed . </s>  for example , during a war , it could use that power to steer steel to a tank factory over an automobile factory . </s>  mr. baker said the federal government must consider making aggressive use of this power to allocate ventilators and masks rolling off production lines , so that they are distributed to where they are needed most rather than risk states fighting for them in bidding wars . </s>  “ we do not want states competing with each other for the same mask , ” mr. baker said . </s>  “ we want best public health practices to determine where resources should flow and in what order. ” how else could it help expand industrial production ? </s>  the government could already be incentivizing rapid changes to expand production capacity and supply of necessary products . </s>  title iii of the defense production act consists of a collection of powers the government could use for this purpose , including making guaranteed loans to help companies develop new production capabilities of goods relevant to the crisis . </s>  the government can also procure and install equipment in factories , including privately owned ones . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › let us help you better understand the

government spend $ 50 million out of a special fund for this purpose before executive branch officials would need to ask congress for additional authority . </s>  what else could the government be doing ? </s>  it could be collecting information about factory equipment to figure out which companies have the capacity to change their production lines and make more needed items . </s>  under section 705 of the defense production act , the government can gather information to make such assessments , wielding subpoena power and criminal penalties if a company owner balks and says the information is proprietary . </s>  the government could use this power to gather information now that would put it in a position to identify which firms would have the capacity to retool if necessary later . </s>  what has trump done ? </s>  he has issued an executive order delegating the ability to invoke powers under the defense production act to alex m. azar ii , the secretary of health and human services , to battle the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  is that , by itself , extraordinary ? </s>  no . </s>  it is a minor bureaucratic thing to do . </s>  in 2016 , president barack obama had already delegated the ability to invoke the defense production act to several cabinet secretaries , for example . </s>  has the trump administration actually used the law ’ s powers ? </s>  this is unclear . </s>  the administration has not announced that mr. azar has ordered any particular company to do any particular thing under the defense production act . </s>  and mr. trump said on twitter that , “ i only signed the defense production act to combat the chinese virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future . </s>  hopefully there will be no need , but we are all in this together ! ” on friday , senator chuck schumer , democrat of new york and the minority leader , said he had urged mr. trump in a phone call to actually use the defense production act to get going on producing more ventilators and other equipment needed to combat the virus , and that mr. trump had yelled to someone in his office to do it now . </s>  later that day , in a testy news conference , mr. trump claimed that he had already used the law to spur production of “ millions of masks. ” but mr. trump has a long history of saying things that have no basis in fact , and no

a former masonic temple as americans returned to hear live music in a concert hall for the first time since the covid-19 pandemic pulled the plug on the nation ’ s entertainment industry . </s>  “ i think this means hope to a lot of people , ” said lance beaty , the president of the company that owns the venue in fort smith , ark. , temple live . </s>  “ this is an experiment , though , on how does that work. ” the concert offered a preview of what music fans may expect from an industry struggling to find a path _forward in the age of social distancing . </s>  forget arenas roiling with

an entire fan pod , even though he came alone . </s>  “ for me it was worth it to have some normalcy , ” he said . </s>  texas , missouri and other states are also gradually reopening entertainment sites and bars , with restrictions . </s>  poe predicted it would be smaller venues like temple live that are the first to reopen because of lower operating costs , fewer staff members and the hesitation of some top-billed artists who work the larger arenas to expose themselves and their fans to the coronavirus . </s>  “ with the economy being the way it is , and ticket prices the way they

she said she had met at a previous show . </s>  “ his voice is amazing and he has the best heart . ” </s>    people like to say that the coronavirus is no respecter of race , class or country , that the disease covid-19 is mindless and will infect anybody it can . </s>  in theory , that is true . </s>  but , in practice , in the real world , this virus behaves like others , screeching like a heat-seeking missile toward the most vulnerable in society . </s>  and this happens not because it prefers them , but because they are more exposed , more fragile and more ill. what the vulnerable portion of society looks like varies from country to country , but in america , that vulnerability is highly intersected with race and poverty . </s>  early evidence from cities and states already shows that black people are disproportionately affected by the virus in devastating ways . </s>  as propublica reported , in milwaukee county , wis. , as of friday morning , 81 percent of the deaths were black people . </s>  black people make up only 26 percent of that county . </s>  as for chicago , wbez reported sunday that “ 70 percent of covid-19 deaths are black , ” and pointed out about

“ at least 40 percent of those killed by the novel coronavirus in michigan so far are black , a percentage that far exceeds the proportion of african-americans in the detroit region and state. ” if this pattern holds true across other states and cities , this virus could have a catastrophic impact on black people in this country . </s>  and yet , we are still not seeing an abundance of news coverage or national governmental response that center on these racial disparities . </s>  many states haven ’ t even released race-specific data on cases and deaths . </s>  the federal government hasn ’ t either . </s>  partly for this reason , we are left with deceptive and deadly misinformation . </s>  the perception that this is a jet-setters ’ disease , or a spring breakers ’ disease , or a “ chinese virus ” as president trump likes to say , must be laid to rest . </s>  the idea that this virus is an equal-opportunity killer must itself be killed . </s>  and , we must dispense with the callous message that the best defense we have against the disease is something that each of us can control : we can all just stay home and keep social distance . </s>  as a report last month by the economic policy institute pointed out , “ less than one in five black workers and roughly one in six hispanic workers are able to work from home. ” as the report pointed out , “ only 9.2 percent of workers in the lowest quartile of the wage distribution can telework , compared with 61.5 percent of workers in the highest quartile. ” if you touch people for a living , in elder care or child care ,

happening here , it is happening with poor people around the world , from new delhi to mexico city . </s>  if they go to work , they must often use crowded mass transportation , because low-wage workers can ’ t necessarily afford to own a car or call a cab . </s>  such is the life of the working poor , or those slightly above poverty , but still struggling . </s>  our entire discussion around this virus is stained with economic elitism . </s>  in social media commentary about images of packed buses and crowds of delivery workers outside restaurants , people chastise black and brown people

and democratically open design for boston city hall catalyzed the city ’ s urban revival in the late 1960s and embodied the era ’ s idealism and civic activism , died on march 27 in beverly , mass . </s>  he was 84 . </s>  his wife and architectural partner , stephanie mallis , said the cause was the coronavirus . </s>  in 1962 , the british-born mr. mckinnell was a 26-year-old graduate student in architecture at columbia university working as a teaching assistant to the german-born architect gerhard kallmann when , almost on a lark , the two entered a competition to design a new boston city hall . </s>  vying with 255 other submissions , they won . </s>  “ they were as amazed as anyone that they prevailed , ” ms. mallis said . </s>  neither had ever built anything . </s>  except for fellow architects , few americans had seen anything quite like the winning proposal — certainly not the city ’ s mayor , john f. collins , who reportedly exclaimed on first seeing the design , “ what the [ expletive ] is that ? ” it wasn ’ t the proper government structure of boston ’ s staid red-brick tradition ; rather , it was a proudly monumental building that would command the vast plaza of the new government center complex with thunderous authority . </s>  what mayor collins saw was the exposed musculature of mighty concrete piers supporting a massive cornice line of offices . </s>  the building was to stand at the edge of a fanning plaza whose bricks entered the ground floor of the structure like a carpet , running up three flights to the city council chambers . </s>  spaces and forms interpenetrated . </s>  sculptural concrete projections that housed the chambers and the mayor ’ s office protruded from a modular facade of offices . </s>  a brick amphitheater of stairs on the ground floor accommodated gatherings of citizens , even spontaneous sit-ins ; the vast plaza in front , inspired by the campo of siena , italy , anticipated the thousands of protesters of those riotous times . </s>  it was a benevolent structure that took the side of the people , guaranteeing citizens free access through porous perimeters in that cradle of american democracy . </s>  twenty years mr. mckinnell ’ s senior , mr. kallmann was best known for publishing an essay about two divergent trends in architecture : one in which buildings were composed rigorously within a controlling grid ; the other , propelled by french and british brutalists , in which designs in concrete embraced sometimes violent breakout forms . </s>  the kallmann-mckinnell design synthesized the two approaches , the rational and the complex . </s>  both men had been educated in british architecture schools that taught that architecture ’ s mission was to build well in the service of a moral and social purpose . </s>  and both had been imbued with the belief that concrete was , as one theorist said , “ the stone of our time. ” built in concrete and brick , their robust city hall design implicitly critiqued the thin commercial glass-and-steel buildings then chilling cities across america . </s>  it was a statement of protest against what mr. mckinnell called the “ degenerate frippery and surface concerns ” of “ cosmetic ” architecture . </s>  its deliberate monumentality expressed a generosity toward the public rather than a corporate idea of minimal expense , and its exposed concrete surfaces gave the building a sense of authenticity — an “ all thoroughness , ” mr. mckinnell said in an interview , admitting that had they had their way , “ we would have used concrete to make the light switches. ” like the sydney opera house , the structure landed on postcards , the two men ’ s design becoming a symbol of the new boston . </s>  and though it proved controversial with some members of the public , who found the rugged materials and bold forms confrontational , it was , for most architects and critics , the masterpiece that would hover over the rest of mr. mckinnell

six-inch ruler in his pocket , explaining that architecture was about measure and scaling the building to the human body . </s>  their emphasis on constructional rigor would earn mr. kallmann and mr. mckinnell the sobriquet “ column and mechanical ” in one of their harvard classes . </s>  but by 1974 , as concrete grew unpopular and a national recession took hold , mr. mckinnell and mr. kallmann

would last the rest of their careers . </s>  mr. kallmann died in 2012 . </s>  they built the academy with a sloping roof , like the houses around it , and they consulted history books to evoke the turn-of-the-20th-century architecture of frank lloyd wright , the brothers charles sumner greene and henry mather greene , and others who used natural materials like wood and stone . </s>  for the academy , city hall ’ s arresting vertical lines were tranquilized into calming horizontals . </s>  and mr. mckinnell relaxed the interiors , realizing that a space for artists , philosophers and historians needed to have “ talking places ” — nooks and crannies for informal conversation . </s>  the critic ada louise huxtable of the new york times wrote approvingly of the project . </s>  “ the architects have felt free to find their answers in terms of existing building types and historical precedents , ” she wrote , “ rather than through the invention of new forms . </s>  the design goes beyond modernism. ” but it was a period of style wars in architecture , and modernists believed mr. mckinnell and mr. kallmann had stepped onto a slippery architectural slope . </s>  indeed , years of postmodernist buildings followed in their portfolio , designs that indulged historicism and traditions less probingly than in the academy building . </s>  “ yes , it was possible to have the rigor and systematic nature of modernism together with some symbolic and representational elements , ” andrea leers , a friend and teaching colleague of mr. mckinnell ’ s , said in an interview . </s>  “ but to most of us , it was a kind of capitulation. ” if the firm lost the attention of modernists , it gained the support of a larger audience , and kallmann mckinnell & wood went on to add scores of

policy intellectuals , and richard haass joins the chorus in “ the world : a brief introduction. ” young americans suffer from poor educations , he contends , while older people find it hard to keep up with profound changes that have unfolded since the cold war order crumbled three decades ago . </s>  the consequences of ignorance , haass warns , are serious : american disengagement from the wider world and poor decision-making at a moment of mounting global dysfunction . </s>  haass possesses undeniable credentials for his concerns . </s>  president of the nonpartisan council on foreign relations since 2003 , haass advised president george h. w. bush from 1989 to 1993 as a member of the national security council and later served as director of the state department ’ s policy planning staff under the younger president bush . </s>  he has also published numerous books on international statecraft , including , in 2017 , “ a world in disarray : american foreign policy and the crisis of the old order , ” which expressed alarm about the crumbling of the american-led international system , established after world war ii , and the challenges of devising something functional to replace it . </s>  but what precisely do americans need to know in order to assure the better future haass hopes for ? </s>  he proposes to answer this question in a book amounting to international affairs 101 . </s>  in two dozen tightly focused chapters covering everything from monetary policy and international law to terrorism and climate change , “ the world ” aims to promote a minimally necessary level of knowledge that haass calls “ global literacy. ” the book eschews any interest in academic theories , which haass gratuitously dismisses as “ too abstract and too far removed from what is happening to be of value to most of us. ” instead , he promises a practical guide to help everyday people understand global forces in which their lives are increasingly enmeshed , even if they do not always know it or like it . </s>  the result is a fair-minded and thorough , if somewhat bloodless , compendium that , by design , contains little likely to surprise informed readers . </s>  condensing so much complexity into a lucid 400 pages is no small accomplishment , but it ’ s easy to wonder whether more colorful prose or probing analysis might have better fulfilled haass ’ s goal of inspiring interest in his subject . </s>  haass ’ s restrained approach does not mean that the book lacks big takeaways . </s>  above all , he underscores the growing disarray that has beset the world since the end of the cold war . </s>  he acknowledges positive trends that have played out in the last few decades , including a fall in the proportion of world population living in extreme poverty from more than one-third 30 years ago to less than one-tenth today . </s>  but haass mostly emphasizes grim developments like declining support for democratic institutions , rapidly growing global inequality and the resurgence of great power rivalries as china and russia assert themselves . </s>  it ’ s hard to argue with his prediction of “ accelerating global disorder ” in the years ahead . </s>  another big theme is the widening gap between the desire of governments to guard their sovereign prerogatives and the inescapability of global problems that can be addressed only through shared sacrifice and the empowerment of international institutions . </s>  the “ vegas rule ” — what happens in a single nation stays there — “ does not apply in today ’ s global world , ” he quips . </s>  greenhouse gases , economic downturns and extremist ideologies , to name just three examples , respect no borders and defy the best efforts of nations to insulate themselves . </s>  the same goes for epidemic diseases . </s>  haass does not mention the coronavirus , which erupted well after he sent his book off to the publisher , and touches on pandemics only in passing . </s>  still , he provides a helpful frame within which to think about a crisis that simultaneously underscores the need for global cooperation against threats that transcend national borders and encourages nations to barricade themselves against dangers from abroad . </s>  if haass had gone to press a few months later , covid-19 might well have been exhibit a for the conflicting trends at the very heart of his analysis . </s>  “ the world ” proceeds in the style of a reference book . </s>  in the first few chapters , haass takes a historical approach , recounting the broad flow of international relations since 1648 , when a peace settlement among the european powers enshrined the notion of sovereign nation-states independent of any higher authority . </s>  marching through modern diplomatic history , haass demonstrates the potential for beneficial balances of power but more often the dangers of disunity and violence in a world organized in this way . </s>  missing from his analysis is any detailed exploration of the historical roles played by companies , religious movements , activist groups and international organizations in shaping the behavior of nations . </s>  when the book turns to major political , economic and demographic developments in each of the world ’ s major regions , mostly it tells a tale of woe . </s>  some problems are easy to see : tensions stirred by a rising china , nuclear-tinged hostility between india and pakistan , civil wars in many parts of africa . </s>  other problems make fewer headlines , including the erosion of democracy and civil authority in the relatively stable western hemisphere and the difficulties of providing education and jobs for rapidly growing populations in asia and africa . </s>  haass next delves into the array of crosscutting global problems . </s>  here , the news is not all bad . </s>  nations have achieved results in combating terrorism and constraining the spread of weapons of mass destruction . </s>  in other arenas including the policing of cyberspace and coping with refugees , however , he sees little reason for optimism . </s>  as for the environment , he bluntly predicts climate change may be “ the defining issue of this century. ” haass makes his only really eyebrow-raising move in the final section of his book , where he considers tools like alliances , international law and institutions like the united nations that governments might use to impose order on a chaotic world . </s>  he deals effectively with these topics , demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of each as an order-making possibility . </s>  in a curious departure from the cautiously didactic approach he pursues elsewhere , however , he concludes with a plea for renewed american leadership on the world stage , backed by american military muscle , as the best bet for stability and progress in the years ahead . </s>  he may be right . </s>  the american-led world order delivered broad prosperity , geopolitical stability and democratization for more than half a century . </s>  perhaps the united states can reclaim something of its accustomed role , to the benefit of all . </s>  but haass passes too quickly over some of the impediments to realization of such a vision . </s>  does the united states any longer possess either the material strength or international appeal to claim a leadership role ? </s>  more important , are most americans , even if they grasp the complexities of international affairs , willing to support anything like the role played by their country in the second half of the 20th century ? </s>  to put it differently , would americans change their ways if they knew more ? </s>  haass views education as the path to the renewal he espouses . </s>  but it could be that many americans , weary of draining overseas commitments and anxious to concentrate on problems closer to home , might weigh the costs and benefits of global activism and make a different choice . </s>    amid continued coronavirus concerns — and following a contentious debate over its funding — the john f. kennedy center for the performing arts on monday postponed or canceled all live events through aug. 9 , including a summer production of “ hamilton . ” the kennedy center , a cultural mainstay in washington and home to the national symphony orchestra and the washington national opera , had already canceled performances through may 22 . </s>  with nearly three more months of suspended programming , the center said on monday that in total , since it first closed on march 13 , more than 1,000 events and performances have been postponed or canceled . </s>  the kennedy center was the focus of partisan scrutiny after the government ’ s $ 2 trillion stimulus package — including $ 25 million for the center — was signed into law in march . </s>  the center originally announced it would furlough the national symphony orchestra ’ s 96 musicians along with other kennedy center workers , a move it insisted was financially necessary even with the aid from the package , before reversing course and instead cutting its musicians ’ pay by 35 percent through early september . </s>  the orchestra will reschedule its three-week celebration of beethoven ’ s 250th birthday , and its concerts with trey anastasio , ben folds and amos lee were canceled . </s>  the center also canceled a series of performances from the second city improv troupe . </s>  the entire 14-week run of “ hamilton , ” set to begin on june 16 at the center ’ s opera house and go through sept. 20 , will be

this time , we are not able to gather physically , communally , as we have before for the safety of our artists , staff and patrons , ” the kennedy center ’ s president , deborah rutter , said in a statement . </s>  “ i am heartbroken by these necessary steps that have emptied our halls that are usually bursting with the sights and sounds of creative genius. ” many prominent performing arts institutions have already canceled their summer schedules , including the public theater ’ s shakespeare in the park , the edinburgh festival fringe in scotland and the oregon shakespeare festival . </s>  others are tentatively hoping to go on : the barrington stage company in massachusetts is making extensive modifications to its space and schedule , and the muny in st. louis is still planning

pushed markets steadily higher , breaking the link between analyst forecasts and the direction of stock prices . </s>  most companies in the s & p 500 stock index have reported their first-quarter earnings , and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on profits is becoming clear , at least for january through march . </s>  on a per-share basis , profits of s & p 500 companies fell by 13 percent , making it the worst slump since 2009 . </s>  analysts think things will get worse before they get better . </s>  at the end of march , the consensus among analysts was that profits at companies that make up the index would sink a modest 1.8 percent in 2020 . </s>  but after digesting the financial reports of companies from agilent technologies to zions bancorp , they now think 2020 profits will tumble more than 20 percent . </s>  any finance textbook ’ s section on equity prices holds that the direction of the stock market is determined , to a large extent , by the profits and dividends that shareholders expect companies to produce in the future . </s>  and academic research has repeatedly shown that when wall street analysts revise their forecasts for a company ’ s profits , it can move share prices . </s>  traders and investors routinely take note of when analysts erase earlier expectations , using those revisions as a real-time gauge of how the fundamental business prospects of corporate america are looking . </s>  going by the conventional wisdom , the current collapse in profit expectations — and analysts ’ woeful prognoses for future earnings — should be clobbering share prices . </s>  but investors don ’ t appear to be taking their cues from analysts . </s>  the s & p 500 has soared more than 30 percent over the last two months . </s>  to be sure , investors priced in some downturn in profits when stocks suffered a 34 percent collapse in february and march . </s>  they were right , and the pain , reflected in earnings reports , was widespread . </s>  bank earnings were fairly awful . </s>  quarterly profits at jpmorgan chase , wells fargo and bank of america all undershot wall street expectations , thanks to the costs of setting aside large amounts of cash to cover an expected surge in borrowers who can ’ t make loan payments because they ’ re suddenly unemployed . </s>  numbers from credit card issuers like capital one and discover were also ugly . </s>  firms that rely on discretionary consumer spending were , unsurprisingly , hammered . </s>  the casino operator las vegas sands posted a first-quarter loss of $ 51 million , compared with a

percent drop stocks suffered on average after falling short of expectations in recent years , according to research from the data provider factset . ) </s>  close observers of stocks won ’ t be surprised . </s>  after all , market sentiment has grown increasingly detached from the abysmal outlook for economic growth , another supposedly fundamental building block of market prices . </s>  instead , stocks have climbed even as the consensus expectation among wall street economists forecasts a 30 percent annualized rate of decline for gross domestic product this quarter , according to factset . </s>  plenty of explanations have been offered to help explain the market ’ s blasé approach to a bleak reality facing corporate america . </s>  some say the bad economic news was already priced in during the march collapse . </s>  others argue that markets are simply “ discounting ” — that is basically betting — that the u.s. will enjoy a v-shaped , or robust , economic recovery . </s>  another argument is that investors , who tend to be _forward-looking , are simply setting their sights on a future where the pandemic is a distant memory . </s>  the most powerful reason is simpler : it ’ s the actions of the federal reserve . </s>  since march 23 — the day the stock market rally began — the fed has done its best to ensure that the returns on bonds are quite low by signaling its willingness to buy unlimited quantities of treasury and government-backed mortgage bonds . </s>  it has also ventured into buying corporate bonds , which helped push yields on such bonds lower too . </s>  the goal , in part , is to push investors away from the safety of the bond markets and into riskier assets , like stocks . </s>  in a recent note , analysts at jpmorgan argued that these programs by the fed “ likely has a bigger positive impact on equity valuation , compared with the negative impact of the temporary earnings loss. ” translation : the fed ’ s efforts to keep interest rates and bond yields low has more than offset the collapse in profits for s & p 500 companies , helping to keep the market aloft even though corporate profitability and the economy look like they will be gloomy for a while . </s>  a similar thing happened during the last financial crisis . </s>  interest rates and bond yields fell to low levels that would have been unthinkable previously , which many partly attributed to central bank actions . </s>  and for the years that followed prices of assets such as stocks , bonds and real estate all rallied to levels that looked high relative to the sluggish level of economic activity after the crisis . </s>  so while corporate profits are supposed to be the fuel that revs the stock market ’ s engine , in the short term , federal reserve policy remains in the driver ’ s seat . </s>  that explains why investors are willing to ignore what analysts have to say , at least for the moment . </s>    madrid — the coronavirus strikes . </s>

</s>  they are concerned that the rush to adopt pets may not always be in the animals ’ best interests and in some cases have started to put limits in place . </s>  shelter administrators are wondering how committed the adoptive owners are to keeping their new pets — or whether they will then abandon them after the emergency passes . </s>  because dog walking is one of the few activities exempt from spain ’ s stringent lockdown , animal shelter workers worry that this drove up the demand for adoptions . </s>  since march 14 , the country has kept its 47 million residents under strict and closely monitored control , forbidding almost everyone — including all children — from taking even a short stroll outside the house . </s>  “ if you ’ re in a hurry to adopt , i see that as a very bad signal , particularly as it ’ s clear there are people who want to adopt in order to have an excuse to walk the streets — which in turn means that these animals could be either returned to us or abandoned , ” said javier rodellar , the president of anerpa , an animal protection association . </s>  mr. rodellar said his group suspended all adoptions and limited even temporary placements to its

your audience decent health information . </s>  fox news finally got much more serious in its reporting on the coronavirus , as has mr. trump ( the my pillow guy aside ) . </s>  convinced by experts ’ new estimates that millions of americans would be at risk for infection and hundreds of thousands at risk for dying if he prematurely reopened the country , mr. trump and fox have gone into reverse . </s>  and , to my surprise , as the pandemic has worsened , my mother started to listen to other sources of information , like her children and other news outlets . </s>  she ’ s been sheltering in

when mr. trump and fox news initially shifted to a story line about getting back to work — even though it was too early — that the problems with fox really sank in for her . </s>  she now seems to realize that she bears some of the burden as a news consumer , though she remains a fox news acolyte . </s>  so by the time the lieutenant governor of texas , dan patrick , was on fox on march 23

checking account and the amount of cash available to her brother at the a.t.m. , putting him on an allowance . </s>  she soon discovered that he was drinking again , his debit card charges betraying him and listing two , three , even four bar tabs a day at his favorite village spots . </s>  it is not unlikely that he simply forgot earlier visits that day , and entered the bar each time as if it were the first . </s>  she could also tell when he used an a.t.m . </s>  he tried to withdraw cash several times a day , even when the account was empty , having forgotten earlier attempts . </s>  the pings from the bank brought her comfort . </s>  “ i know he ’ s ok , ” she said . </s>  “ he ’ s walking around. ” but his old circle of friends were increasingly frustrated . </s>  “ i had a relatively young daughter at the time , and i felt i was maybe investing too much time in him , ” ms. saxe said . </s>  “ i stopped going around to see him. ” mr. riordan would stop by and ask the doormen how his friend was getting along , but he found himself reluctant to ring his bell . </s>  he once happened upon a wild-looking mr. pannkuk — who in the past had been known to return to his stylist after a haircut if it wasn ’ t to his liking — shambling along the sidewalk . </s>  “ i watched people ’ s faces as they approached him , ” he said . </s>  “ he was an eyeful — people were having second takes . </s>  little did they know he was about to take a right into a very chic apartment. ” pulled from the shadows by 2017 , he was destroying that apartment from within . </s>  he

casting the apartment in dim shadows . </s>  he threw away food he didn ’ t remember buying , filling his refrigerator instead with rows of plastic cups of water . </s>  mr. cohen began visiting once a week just to make sure mr. pannkuk was eating . </s>  ms. martinez , the friend who looked to him as a father figure , dropped by the liquor stores and the lion ; she claimed to be his daughter and begged them not to serve him anymore . </s>  it was in this period , in the spring of 2017 , that mr. pannkuk was arrested after throwing away his neighbor ’ s belongings . </s>  in all likelihood , he probably believed he was in his own apartment , and treated those things like he did his own property that he did not recognize . </s>  i first encountered mr. pannkuk after reading a police

from the shadows and into the city ’ s view . </s>  mr. pannkuk ’ s sister and friends contacted for this story agreed to speak about his past and present with the understanding that no article would be written until his situation stabilized . </s>  jan , his sister , said she saw an opportunity to share her brother ’ s story with others facing addiction or brain trauma issues . </s>  after his arrest , mr. pannkuk was appointed a lawyer , and while the criminal charge was later dropped , the matter of what to do about mr. pannkuk lingered . </s>  in 2017 , his case was referred to surrogate ’ s court , where he sat in silent bewilderment as his lawyer and representatives from the city and the mental hygiene legal service , which represents the disabled in need of care , discussed his future before a judge . </s>  the primary obstacle to bringing mr. pannkuk the aid available to many new yorkers was his wealth , as manifested in the apartment on ninth street . </s>  he had too much money to qualify for free assistance , and not enough for live-in care . </s>  “ there are a lot of difficulties going on in your life right now , ” judge kelly o ’ neill levy told him in september 2017 . </s>  “ the court finds that the appointment of a guardian is necessary. ” at the same time , the apartment building , a co-op , was threatening eviction proceedings against mr. pannkuk . </s>  his guardian , sabrina e. morrissey , a manhattan lawyer who worked with clients from vulnerable populations , represented him and his wishes to stay in the apartment , but in reality that appeared less and less of an option . </s>  his sister and ms. morrissey agreed : it was time for him to go . </s>  late in 2018 , his guardian led mr. pannkuk , 70 , from his apartment of 23 years to his new

against a blank wall . </s>  a health aide knocked and offered him a bowl of rice pudding . </s>  mr. pannkuk asked if she would please put it in the refrigerator . </s>  “ i ’ ve been to london , france , russia , ” he said , and for a moment , he looked like any other retired executive , thinking back over the good times . </s>  “ i ’ ve been to india. ” then , inevitably , that look of comfort shifted to one of urgency , and the room around him changed from comfortable studio to forbidding cell . </s>  “ you know , my apartment is in manhattan , ” he said . </s>  “ i ’ d love to go

confirmed coronavirus infections in europe and the united states , discovered in january , did not ignite the epidemics that followed , according to a close analysis of hundreds of viral genomes . </s>  instead , the outbreaks plaguing much of the west began weeks later , the study concluded . </s>  the revised timeline may clarify nagging ambiguities about the arrival of the pandemic . </s>  for example , while president trump has frequently claimed that a ban on travelers from china prevented the epidemic from becoming much worse , the new data suggest that the virus that started washington state ’ s epidemic arrived roughly two weeks after the ban was imposed on feb. 2 . </s>  and the authors argue that the relatively late emergence of the outbreak means that more lives could have been saved by early action , such as testing and contact tracing . </s>  the new analysis is not the last word . </s>  scientific understanding of the coronavirus is evolving almost daily , and this type of research yields a range of possible results , not complete certainty . </s>  many infections in washington state seem to have occurred in early february , and other models suggested that the epidemic there began closer to the beginning of the month . </s>  but a number of virus experts said that the new report convincingly rules out a connection between the first confirmed cases and the later outbreaks . </s>  “ this paper clearly shows this didn ’ t happen , ” said kristian andersen , a computational biologist at the scripps research institute in san diego , who was not involved in the research . </s>  michael worobey , an evolutionary biologist at the university of arizona , and his colleagues posted a preliminary version of their study online on saturday . </s>  it has not yet been published in a scientific journal . </s>  viruses develop genetic mutations at a roughly regular rate as they multiply . </s>  scientists can use these mutations to reconstruct a virus ’ s movement through a population and to estimate when an outbreak began in a region . </s>  the first confirmed coronavirus case in the united states was a man who flew from china to the seattle-tacoma

 alarmed , he and his colleagues concluded that the most likely explanation for the slight difference was that wa1 had circulated in washington state for six weeks , gaining the mutations along the way . </s>  the implication was that there might be hundreds of people already infected in the state , setting the stage for an explosion of cases . </s>  officials reacted to the news with aggressive measures that public health experts credit with reining in the outbreak . </s>  initially , dr. worobey found the work by dr. bedford and his colleagues “ pretty darn convincing. ” but as time passed

washington state outbreak , the computer could not reproduce the viral mutations found there in later weeks . </s>  it was close to impossible for wa1 to have seeded the outbreak , the scientists decided . </s>  it was far more likely that the wa2 group of viruses was introduced to washington from china sometime around feb. 13th and set off the epidemic . </s>  that was about two weeks after mr. trump banned most travelers from china . </s>  according to an analysis by the new york times , however , about 40,000 people made the journey to the united states in the two months after those restrictions were imposed . </s>  many were admitted under rules that exempted american citizens and others . </s>  they were funneled to a few international hubs , including seattle-tacoma international airport . </s>  dr. worobey speculated that the virus that started the state ’ s epidemic arrived by that route , or perhaps to the seattle area via vancouver . </s>  there was no

: may 13 , 2020 the reveal our lives have been changed in so many ways since march 13 when the president announced a covid-19 national emergency and march 15 when the center for disease control and prevention advised no gathering of 50 or more people in the united states . </s>  though we practice social distancing , we know that the threat of the coronavirus will not be mitigated until there is a vaccine or herd-immunity dampens the threat . </s>  the estimates on the amount of time needed to find a vaccine and get it to the public run from the historical average of 16 years to the president ’ s goal of 12 - 18 months . </s>  what ’ s behind these numbers ? </s>  the april 30 , 2020 new york times opinion article “ how long will a vaccine really take ? </s>  ” provided these graphs and more . </s>  by toggling the eleven time-saving options , you can see the time saved for each step of the process . </s>  but , with every time-saving option , there are additional costs and increased health and safety risks . </s>  there are other options to reduce the effect of covid-19 including developing therapeutic drugs , more rigorous testing , and contact tracing . </s>  the opinion article concludes with this perspective : “ if all those things come together , life might return to normal long before a vaccine is ready to shoot into your arm. ” here are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of these graphs : “ are the dreams of a vaccine reasonable ? ” by connor of north carolina , “ the course to curing corona ” by reilly of hoggard high school in wilmington , north carolina , “ the vaccine for covid-19 : are we rushing things ? ” by jocelyn of ohio , and “ the rush to cure covid ” by marko of missouri . </s>  you may want to think critically about these questions . </s>  the clinical trial graph states that the historical probability that a drug will complete the trial process is 9.6 % . </s>  the below stat nugget explains that to find this probability , the probabilities of the sequence of events for approval are multiplied . </s>  by example , here is a way to show why this works . </s>  let ’ s start with 1,000 different drug trials . </s>  if 37 % of them fail the phase i trial , how many drugs successfully complete phase i and go onto phase ii ? </s>  now , these successful phase i drugs go through a more rigorous phase ii trial . </s>  if 69 % of them fail the phase ii trial , how many drugs pass the phase ii trial ? </s>  this number will be smaller than the one above because there were fewer drugs in the phase ii trial than in the phase i trial and many of the phase i successful drugs have failed . </s>  now , these successful phase ii drugs go through an even more extensive phase iii trial . </s>  if 42 % of them fail the phase iii trial , how many advance to the application stage ? </s>  finally , these successful phase iii drugs go through the final application stage . </s>  if 85 % of them fail the application stage , how many of the original 1,000 drugs get the go ahead to be manufactured and distributed ? </s>  take this number and divide it by the initial 1,000 number of drugs going through the trial process . </s>  this number is approximately 9.6 % . </s>  from the original article that included the interactive typical and goal critical path diagrams , you can see that the typical process takes on average 192 months ( 16 years ) and the goal process , which moves at “ pandemic speed , ” takes 15 months ( 1 year , 3 months ) — a difference of 177 months ( 14 years , 9 months ) . </s>  the critical path of the goal process assumes that there are no setbacks or delays in obtaining approvals , manufacturing or distribution . </s>  from the following interactive graphs , you can determine where those 177 months came from . </s>  for example , let ’ s look at the first time-saving option : “ start trials early. ” if the trials start early by relying on the work from studying sars and mers to shorten preparation before clinical trials , the typical process would end in may 2036 , but the goal process would end in january 2034 . </s>  that is a 28 month ( 2 years , 4 month ) difference . </s>  ( for each comparison , make sure you start all toggles at the default of no action . ) </s>  do this for each of the eleven time-savings strategies . </s>  they will total more than the 177 months difference calculated above since the goal process has some overlapping activities . </s>  for any project , there is a balancing of cost , time , and quality . </s>  you can try to maximize two of these , but that is usually at the expense of the third . </s>  in the case of a vaccine , what are some of the many characteristics of quality ? </s>  the tradeoffs of cost , time , and quality for each of the eleven time-saving options need to be considered . </s>  for each , is saving time worth the additional cost ? </s>  is saving time worth the additional risk of life ? </s>  review the eleven time-saving options by reading their description and the amount of time saved . </s>  which options seem the most likely to produce a successful result ? </s>  which do you think should be avoided ? </s>  below in the stat nuggets , we define and explain mathematical terms that apply to the graph . </s>  thank you for participating in “ what ’ s going on in this graph ? ” which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data . </s>  critical thinking is an essential element of statistics , the science of

with their possible outcomes , as branches ( lines ) , and the probability of each outcome occurring . </s>  a probability tree diagram consists of a series of sequential events where the outcomes shown in each branch are based on the condition that the prior events have occurred . </s>  to calculate the probability of the outcome resulting from any particular branch ( a conditional probability ) , the probabilities of the sequence of events are multiplied . </s>  in the clinical trial graph , the events are phase i , phase ii , phase iii , and application . </s>  the possible outcomes for each of these events is success and failure . </s>  the probabilities for failing are shown in the graph : 37 % , 69 % , 42 % , and 15 % , respectively . </s>  because the events can only result in either a success or failure , the probability of success for each branch can be calculated by subtracting the probability of failing from 100 % . </s>  the resulting probability of success of each event is 63 % , 31 % , 58 % , and 85 % , respectively . </s>  to calculate the probability that a drug will complete the process successfully , multiply these percentages ( 0.63 x 0.31 x 0.58 x 0.85 ) . </s>  the result is that 9.6 % of the drug trials ultimately received f.d.a . </s>  approval . </s>  critical path diagram a critical path diagram is a graph of all of the activities that are required to complete a project in the order they must occur and with the time to complete each activity . </s>  a project ’ s critical path can be calculated from a critical path chart . </s>  the critical path gives the amount of time that is needed to complete all necessary activities in a project . </s>  in the vaccine timeline graph , there are nine activities , in order of the typical process : academic research , pre-clinical , three phases , building factories , manufacturing , approval , and distribution . </s>  each activity is completed before the next one begins . </s>  the durations are shown on the diagram . </s>  the critical path is 192 months ( 16 years ) . </s>  in the proposed goal process , all activities have shorter durations and their schedules overlap . </s>  the critical path is 15 months ( 1 year , 3 months ) . </s>  the goal process assumes that there are no setbacks or delays in obtaining approvals , manufacturing , or distribution . </s>  ________ the graphs for “ what ’ s going on in this graph ? ” are selected in partnership with sharon hessney . </s>  ms. hessney wrote the “ reveal ” and stat nuggets with erica chauvet , a mathematics professor at waynesburg university in pennsylvania , and moderates online with chris adkisson , math teacher at pulaski county high school in somerset , kentucky . </s>    the electric future , as dreamed up in the 1990s , centered on groundbreaking cars like general motors ’ ev1 : tiny , faceless transportation pods , their sci-fi bubble shapes a testament to aerodynamic function over stylistic form . </s>  in 2020 , the equivalent of a three-ton fist would jolt awake any futurist or environmentalist of that era : say hello to g.m. ’ s 1,000-horsepower electric hummer , that onetime green scourge , now rehabilitated to pass muster at any silicon valley cocktail party . </s>  behold the beefy pickup trucks from ford and chevrolet , as well as upstarts like rivian and bollinger . </s>  elon musk at tesla couldn ’ t resist upstaging rivals with the concept cybertruck , a truck so mad max-macho that it makes a hummer seem discreet . </s>  beyond the pickup realm , new electric models from tesla , audi , jaguar , mercedes-benz , bmw and cadillac share a common trait : they ’ re all luxury s.u.v.s , with rich accommodations , potent acceleration and generous space for families . </s>  mr. musk expects his new model y crossover s.u.v . </s>  to be tesla ’ s most popular model yet . </s>  mainstream brands , including ford , toyota , hyundai and kia , are also forgoing small cars and family sedans in favor of plug-in s.u.v.s , including the eagerly awaited ford mustang mach-e . </s>  in this environment , the mini cooper se , an urban cutie-pie with a slight 110-mile driving range , looks like an anomaly rather than the shape of things to come . </s>  rivian is an especially colorful , full-scale illustration of the industry ’ s change of heart and tactics . </s>  when rj scaringe founded rivian , after earning an engineering doctorate at the massachusetts institute of technology , his small e.v . </s>  company completed a two-seat sports car before he tore up the plans in favor of the sleek r1t pickup and r1s s.u.v . </s>  s.u.v.s have achieved something like global dominance , and mr. scaringe acknowledged electric automakers ’ sense of “ can ’ t beat ’ em , join ’ em. ” barring government actions that force buyers ’ hands , he said , the threat of climate change alone isn ’ t enough to make most people give up the family-size , all-wheel-drive models they ’ ve come to love . </s>  “ the wrong answer is to say everyone has to drive around in little vehicles , ” he said . </s>  “ to tell them they have to switch to a completely different segment , that ’ s a really hard ask. ” but mr. scaringe , a change-the-world entrepreneur who believes all transportation must switch from fossil fuels to electricity from sustainable sources , said there was more to it than that . </s>  he echoed longtime industry logic : that transforming the most egregious gas guzzlers and emitters of carbon dioxide — which also happen to be the industry ’ s most popular and profitable models — will save exponentially more energy than nominal gains for smaller cars that use relatively little gasoline . </s>  “ the vehicle that ’ s the least efficient on the road is also the most desired segment , ” he said . </s>  while coronavirus shutdowns have pushed its expected arrival deeper into 2021 — and may delay almost every electric competitor as well — the r1t looks like a trucker ’ s fantasy of style , tech and outdoor adventure . </s>  there are electric motors at all four wheels , up to 750 horsepower and 400 miles of driving range , and showstopping features like an optional camp kitchen — with dual stovetop burners , a sink and utensil storage — that slides out from a “ gear tunnel ” between the passenger cab and cargo bed . </s>  rivian is backed by a combined $ 1.2 billion investment from ford and amazon . </s>  but in the wake of the pandemic , ford killed a plan for rivian to build a lincoln-branded s.u.v . </s>  based on its electric “ skateboard platform. ” rivian still has a deal to build 100,000 amazon delivery vans through 2030 . </s>  while some analysts continue to treat e.v.s as inevitable , there are warning signs . </s>  jaguar ’ s electric i-pace s.u.v . </s>  fell flat on its pretty face , finding just 2,594 buyers in the united states last year . </s>  a $ 70,000 base price , $ 25,000 more than jaguar ’ s gas-powered f-pace s.u.v. , didn ’ t help , nor did a stingy 234-mile driving range . </s>  tesla models aside , no e.v . </s>  has scored as a genuine sales hit in america , even affordable models like the chevrolet bolt . </s>  karl brauer , executive publisher of cox automotive , underlined that automakers , including tesla , had yet to prove that e.v.s could be a profitable long-term business . </s>  “ to say , ‘ we ’ ve made a full e.v . </s>  truck , and we ’ re actually making money on it , ’ will be quite an accomplishment , ” mr. brauer said . </s>  the price of batteries has a lot to do with that , even as automakers have driven down costs sharply . </s>  mr. brauer said that was another reason automakers were recruiting trucks and s.u.v.s to lead their electric invasions . </s>  “ there ’ s been an ‘ aha ’ moment among carmakers , ” he said . </s>  “ there ’ s a massive amount of profit built into the average truck . </s>  and you can hide and absorb the cost of these batteries much easier in a $ 50,000-to- $ 70,000 s.u.v . </s>  than a $ 20,000 economy car. ” those pickups and sport-utes have been detroit ’ s cash cows for decades , and s.u.v.s are now the profit centers for every major automaker , including such unexpected brands as porsche , bentley and lamborghini . </s>  still , hiding the cost of those lithium-ion batteries remains a challenge in electric trucks , simply because there ’ s so much battery to hide : while rivian expects its smooth-skinned trucks to deliver segment-best aerodynamic efficiency , it still takes enormous batteries to motivate such large vehicles , especially for consumers who demand reasonable driving range . </s>  g.m. ’ s moneymaking strategy hinges on its new ultium batteries , to be built with south korea ’ s lg chem in a new $ 2.3 billion plant near lordstown , ohio . </s>  that ’ s part of a $ 20 billion push into e.v.s and autonomous cars , with 20 models expected by 2023 , including the reborn hummer , a cadillac lyriq s.u.v . </s>  and an electric chevrolet silverado pickup around 2025 . </s>  g.m . </s>  projects one million annual electric-car sales in north america and china by mid-decade , which would be more than 12 percent of the roughly eight million cars that g.m . </s>  sells worldwide . </s>  ken morris , g.m. ’ s vice president for electric and autonomous vehicles , said any e.v . </s>  that expected mass sales must hit a 300-mile range . </s>  to bump that to 400 miles , g.m . </s>  will stack up to 24 ultium modules , with 200 kilowatt-hours of stored energy , in its largest and most capable trucks — double the size of tesla ’ s current largest packs . </s>  unlike any competitor , mr. morris said , those pouch-style ultium batteries can be stacked vertically , not just horizontally , for more efficient packaging . </s>  a battery pack that size may weigh close to 2,000 pounds , more than the total weight of the world ’ s first hybrid , the honda insight of 1999 . </s>  for the company ’ s most robust truck applications , dc fast charging could deliver 100 miles of driving range in just 10 minutes on the plug . </s>  critically , mr. morris said , the ultium design and g.m. ’ s huge economies of scale will drive the battery costs to about $ 100 per kilowatt-hour of stored energy , long the holy grail of battery development . </s>  he cautioned that back-of-the-envelope calculations weren ’ t exact . </s>  but at $ 100 per kilowatt-hour , a 200 kilowatt-hour battery would cost its manufacturer $ 20,000 , more than the price of some basic economy cars . </s>  for all that , mr. morris underlined g.m. ’ s pledge that its e.v.s will be profitable from the get-go . </s>  the trick for every automaker will be to price them attractively enough to lure customers from fossil-fueled models , but not so low that they can ’ t earn a profit . </s>  “ you can ’ t charge tons more for an electric pickup , and we understand that , ” mr. morris said . </s>  “ you have to manage the price point to be in the right spot. ” auto executives concede that , all things being equal , a three-ton truck will never match the energy efficiency of a perky hatchback — or those hollywood-style bubbles people once envisioned as 21st-century transportation . </s>  yet mr. scaringe notes that a tiny hatchback can ’ t carry seven passengers , venture off the beaten path with four-wheel drive or swallow loads of cargo . </s>  a final question is whether american buyers , including truck traditionalists — rarely known for obsessing over fuel efficiency — are truly ready to leap into an electric future , especially when cheap and plentiful gasoline is flowing . </s>  ted cannis , ford ’ s global director for electrification , believes they are . </s>  when ford wrapped its f-150 in a weight-saving aluminum body , he said , many analysts questioned whether truck loyalists would go for it . </s>  the same skepticism greeted ford ’ s plan to offer downsized , turbocharged v-6 engines as an alternative to powerful yet thirsty v-8s . </s>  now , roughly 60 percent of f-150 buyers choose the more fuel-efficient v-6 engines . </s>  mr. cannis sees that as evidence that ford can convert f-150 buyers . </s>  given that ford found nearly 900,000 f-series buyers in america last year , converting just one in nine would give it 100,000 electric pickup sales . </s>  considering the cold shoulder that americans have given to any e.v . </s>  that doesn ’ t wear a tesla badge , that would be considered a good start . </s>    two weeks ago , an unexpected cluster of coronavirus cases in new rochelle , n.y. , seemed an unnerving sign that an outbreak that had devastated china and italy was taking hold in the new york region and could spread rapidly . </s>  the state took drastic measures that stirred a backlash , including creating a containment zone . </s>  but now , the latest data indicates that the measures may be starting to work . </s>  the outbreak , which gov . </s>  andrew m. cuomo once said was advancing “ unabated ” in new rochelle , has appeared to slow : over the last four days , only 38 new cases were reported to the county . </s>  “ everybody talks about flattening the curve , and i think that ’ s exactly what we were able to do in new rochelle , ” said dr. sherlita amler , the westchester county health commissioner . </s>  “ we know we can ’ t stop every single case , but our goal was to reduce the number of cases , and i do think the measures were successful in doing that. ” state and local health officials cautioned that it was too early to declare victory , but the results seemed to show how tough social distancing measures , first adopted here and then imposed around the country , combined with an aggressive testing philosophy , can have an impact on curbing the coronavirus . </s>  the experience in new rochelle , a small city just north of new york city , has converted early skeptics , including some residents who had chafed at the restrictions . </s>  “ in the beginning , it felt like house arrest , ” said samuel heilman , a new rochelle resident whose family was among those ordered to self-quarantine on march 3 . </s>  the families had all attended the same synagogue , young israel of new rochelle , as a lawyer who was the first person diagnosed with the coronavirus in the community . </s>  “ in effect , it felt like we were being punished , ” mr. heilman said . </s>  “ but the punishment turned out to be a blessing in disguise . </s>  this is really a case of perspective. ” although aggressive testing and confinement orders have shown promise in new rochelle and elsewhere , including in south korea , it may be too late to employ similar strategies in places like new york city , where the number of positive cases has overwhelmed the city ’ s ability to offer tests broadly or to trace the contacts of those infected . </s>  the lawyer at the center of the new rochelle cluster , lawrence garbuz , 50 , fell ill on about feb. 27 , and was confirmed on march 2 to have the coronavirus . </s>  health officials began to trace his contacts and soon found more infections . </s>  state and westchester county health officials ordered the closure of the synagogue , and on march 3 ordered quarantines for the more than 100 families that were exposed to mr. garbuz at a funeral and a bat mitzvah in late february . </s>  as more synagogue members became infected , those who came in contact with them were also quarantined . </s>  state and local health investigators also used contact-tracing techniques to track down people who were exposed to mr. garbuz , including workers at newyork-presbyterian lawrence hospital in bronxville , n.y. , where mr. garbuz was initially hospitalized . </s>  the containment zone in new rochelle began on march 12 ; it was a one-mile radius , with young israel at its epicenter , that was to last for 14 days . </s>  the order did not close streets or prevent people from leaving , but it banned gatherings of over 500 and closed schools , houses of worships and other large gathering spaces within the zone . </s>  members of the new york state national guard were called in to deliver meals to people stuck in their homes , and to deep-clean communal buildings . </s>  an incident command center was established on huguenot street , from where health care workers would fan out across the city in groups of three , dressed head to toe in protective gear to test quarantined residents in their homes . </s>  the state partnered with northwell health to open a drive-through testing center on march 13 on glen island , a 105-acre park connected by drawbridge to the mainland in new rochelle . </s>  the

empty , ’ one european health official says as vaccines dwindle . </s>  biden plans to reopen obamacare exchanges in many states . </s>  but even as the city of 80,000 emerged as the face of the new york epidemic , the reaction from residents and even its leaders was at first uneven . </s>  amy paulin , a state assemblywoman who represents the area , initially pushed back against the governor ’ s quarantine measures . </s>  now she says the governor did a “ phenomenal job. ” “ he proved me wrong , and he was absolutely right , ” she said . </s>  other residents begged for the stringent measures in the containment zone to be expanded to the entire city . </s>  groups of teachers at schools outside the zone that remained open — even though some students lived within the zone — gathered outside city hall on north avenue in the days after the announcement to demand their schools be shut , too . </s>  on march 12 , laura feijóo , the schools superintendent who initially resisted measures to close the entire district , relented , ordering all schools shut . </s>  ( a little over a week later , on march 21 , she disclosed that she had contracted covid-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus . ) </s>  “ even though it ’ s leapfrogged continents and oceans , our leaders thought that they somehow could contain it in a one-mile circle ? ” said calvin heyward , 57 , a sixth-grade math teacher at isaac e. young middle school in new rochelle , just outside the containment area . </s>  since march 13 , mr. heyward said , he has been in and out of the emergency room with complications from the coronavirus , for which his partner also has tested positive . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › words to know about testing confused by the terms about coronavirus testing ? </s>  let us help : antibody : a protein produced by the immune system that can recognize and attach precisely to specific kinds of viruses , bacteria , or other invaders . </s>  antibody test/serology test : a test that detects antibodies specific to the coronavirus . </s>  antibodies begin to appear in the blood about a week after the coronavirus has infected the body . </s>  because antibodies take so long to develop , an antibody test can ’ t reliably diagnose an ongoing infection . </s>  but it can identify people who have been exposed to the coronavirus in the past . </s>  antigen test : this test detects bits of coronavirus proteins called antigens . </s>  antigen tests are fast , taking as little as five minutes , but are less accurate than tests that detect genetic material from the virus . </s>  coronavirus : any virus that belongs to the orthocoronavirinae family of viruses . </s>  the coronavirus that causes covid-19 is known as sars-cov-2 . </s>  covid-19 :

contagious disease from those who are not sick . </s>  quarantine refers to restricting the movement of people who have been exposed to a virus . </s>  nasopharyngeal swab : a long , flexible stick , tipped with a soft swab , that is inserted deep into the nose to get samples from the space where the nasal cavity meets the throat . </s>  samples for coronavirus tests can also be collected with swabs that do not go as deep into the nose — sometimes called nasal swabs — or oral or throat swabs . </s>  polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) : scientists use pcr to make millions of copies of genetic material in a sample . </s>  tests that use pcr enable researchers to detect the coronavirus even when it is scarce . </s>  viral load : the amount of virus in a person ’ s body . </s>  in people infected by the coronavirus , the viral load may peak before they start to show symptoms , if symptoms appear at all . </s>  on wednesday , the order declaring the containment area was lifted ; but by then its requirements had been rendered moot by an encompassing stay-at-home statewide order that the governor enacted last week . </s>  “ the discouraging way to look at this is to say , the containment zone that was established in new rochelle , and which looked like a forceful and necessary action when it was initiated , became obsolete within a week , ” said noam bramson , the mayor of new rochelle . </s>  “ the positive way to look at it , ” he added , “ is to say that at least preliminarily , those early actions have been effective. ” westchester county has adopted an aggressive testing philosophy : more than 29,000 of the county ’ s less than one million residents have been tested , according to the county department of health , with 7,187 positive for covid-19 as of friday . </s>  statewide , about 138,000 people have been tested . </s>  in new york city , with a population over eight times the size of westchester county , just under 58,000 people had been tested as of friday , according to the state . </s>  the rate of hospitalization for cases in westchester was hovering at around 1 percent . </s>  of the more than 6,400 people hospitalized statewide , 73 were in westchester , according to county health officials . </s>  of the 12 deaths in the county , none are from new rochelle , although several patients are in critical condition , according to the mayor . </s>  there were 284 cases in the city as of friday , according to data reported to him by the state . </s>  “ the way i heard someone say it ? ” said george latimer , the westchester county executive . </s>  “ about new rochelle , we aren ’ t the worst , we are just the first. ” a new issue has emerged in the city , perhaps one that will be faced by thousands of people who test positive for the virus : new york state rules require anyone outside of new york city to receive two consecutive negative coronavirus tests before they can leave quarantine — a challenge when tests are in short supply . </s>  on friday , a group of quarantined residents sent a letter to dr. amler , the health commissioner , objecting to what they called their “ illegal open-ended isolation orders. ” dr. amler said that as of friday , there would be no change to the county ’ s policy . </s>  there have been other consequences : several nurses who worked swabbing throats and noses at the drive-through testing center have recently been instructed to isolate themselves after a colleague tested positive for the virus , according to a person familiar with the order . </s>  there also have been accommodations that have bound the community closer . </s>  quarantined synagogue members prayed together over zoom , a video calling app . </s>  local restaurants delivered get-well packages . </s>  “ everyone

heading toward a must-win primary in south carolina with a zero-for-three record so far . </s>  and while commentators cringed at some moments — particularly when he claimed credit for writing a bill that amy klobuchar actually wrote — the consensus was that he got what he needed . </s>  “ strong answer from @ joebiden on earning the african-american vote in south carolina and throughout the country. ” — kurt bardella , democratic media strategist and former republican congressional spokesman “ . </s>  @ joebiden interrupting @ amyklobuchar to take credit for writing a bill he did not write ( closing the boyfriend loophole — access to guns for domestic abusers ) is not a good look. ” — kelly dittmar , scholar at rutgers university ’ s center for american women and politics “ @ joebiden had a strong night , which was a must . </s>  he ’ ll win south carolina on saturday and change the trajectory of the race. ” — john weaver , co-founder of project lincoln and former strategist for john kasich “ best debate performance yet from @ joebiden — he ’ s best when his back is against the wall. ” — jennifer palmieri , former spokeswoman for hillary clinton and barack obama michael r. bloomberg mr. bloomberg had a disastrous showing in last week ’ s debate , a point he used for a self-deprecating punchline that did not land at all . </s>  this debate did not earn him great reviews , either — especially , in an echo of last week , when it came to his exchanges with elizabeth warren and to any discussion of stop-and-frisk policing . </s>  but the bar was pretty low after his first performance , and some strategists said he at least cleared that . </s>  “ bloomberg is trying to prove that his sexual harassment was nothing more than bad jokes by repeatedly telling bad jokes. ” — seth masket , director of the center on american politics at the university of denver “ bloomberg looks so agitated and uncomfortable when held accountable by warren . </s>  his whole ‘ enough is never enough for her ’ line felt sexist and dismissive. ” — marc lamont hill , author and professor of media studies at temple university “ bloomberg actually in this debate . </s>  not a natural but slugging away . </s>  solid improvement. ” — mike murphy , republican strategist “ ‘ with this senator , enough is never enough. ’ is that the new ‘ nevertheless she persisted ’ ? </s>  bloomberg is bad at this. ” — shaunna thomas , co-founder and executive director of ultraviolet pete buttigieg mr. buttigieg is heading into a tough stage of the race : if he wants to turn his strong performances in iowa and new hampshire into something lasting , he will have to gain a lot of support very quickly from people of color . </s>  analysts generally thought he did well in the debate , but they were divided on how much it might help him . </s>  “ smart of pete to keep hammering away on down-ballot races. ” — jesse lehrich , former foreign policy spokesman for hillary clinton “ ‘ how can we deliver a revolution if you can ’ t support a rule change ? ’ killer line from @ petebuttigieg to @ berniesanders. ” — frank luntz , republican consultant and pollster “ good

comprehensive answer on the threats we face . </s>  imagine that. ” — jen psaki , former spokeswoman for mr. obama amy klobuchar ms. klobuchar drew praise for bringing up the coronavirus epidemic , and for encouraging viewers to visit not her own website , but the website of the centers for disease control and prevention . </s>  but in a debate in which candidates seemed to be screaming over one another more often than not , she did not seem to break through very much . </s>  “ klobuchar ’ s answer on coronavirus was very strong … and driving viewers to the cdc site really drove home the seriousness of the situation. ” — mo elleithee , executive director of georgetown university ’ s institute of politics and public service and former democratic national committee spokesman “ amy klobuchar ’ s success at positioning herself as a pragmatic moderate is interesting . </s>  … in low information environments , female candidates are perceived as more liberal than men , though klobuchar ’ s candidacy shows that voters respond to candidate messaging. ” — erin cassese , political psychology expert at the university of delaware “ all the blah blah blah from candidates who have

</s>  more than once , the audience booed him , which seemed to surprise him and throw him off his stride . </s>  still , he parried other attacks well , and strategists noted that given his position in the race , he could weather a less-than-stellar performance . </s>  “ bernie just got booed for the second time tonight . </s>  this is his worst # demdebate so far — he ’ s not reading this audience . </s>  he ’ s not listening. ” — frank luntz “ tonight just underscores how big a missed opportunity last week was for all the candidates who ganged up on bloomberg and left bernie alone . </s>  bernie is on the defensive and struggling to turn it around . </s>  and the audience reaction is catching him off guard. ” — mo elleithee “ bernie is the most likely nominee . </s>  no one who needed a home run achieved it , though there were more effective attacks on bernie since bloomberg was ignored more. ” — matt grossmann , director of the institute for public policy and social research at michigan state university “ at the end of the day @ berniesanders once again escapes relatively unscathed from a contentious debate while still enjoying the most speaking time. ” — anna sampaio , professor of political science and ethnic studies at santa clara university tom steyer the commentariat didn ’ t have much bad to say about mr. steyer . </s>  but the hard truth was that they didn ’ t really have much to say about him at all . </s>  “ in the battle of the billionaires … tom steyer is so much better on the debate stage than mike bloomberg is. ” — mo elleithee “ thank you @ tomsteyer for speaking up about # cybersecurity and protecting the integrity of our elections. ” — donna brazile , former democratic national committee chairwoman “ steyer had good moments but i didn ’ t hear a compelling case for his candidacy. ” — laura belin elizabeth warren expectations were high for ms. warren going into tuesday ’ s debate , given both the high stakes ( she is behind in the polls and in delegates ) and her dominant performance at last week ’ s debate . </s>  she did not replicate that performance , and some strategists criticized her decision to once again focus on mr. bloomberg instead of the front-runner , mr. sanders . </s>  but she did have several strong moments , and commentators praised her ability to cut through the free-for-all onstage . </s>  “ the @ ewarren ‘ strategy ’ befuddles me . </s>  this is about winning and not sure where she is trying to gather votes . </s>  a feather duster on bernie , who is going in for the kill against her with rallies in massachusetts. ” — john weaver “ so far warren is the only candidate hasn ’ t lost their cool and stayed focused. ” — karen finney , democratic consultant “ warren is the only candidate who can fundamentally cut into bernie ’ s base & she understands exactly how to do it. ” — jesse lehrich “ ‘ this is a moment to choose hope over fear . </s>  this is our moment. ’ @ ewarren gets in one of the few clear , calm and uninterrupted responses before the # demdebate break. ” — kelly dittmar </s>    before the pandemic , before the great recession , before proliferating hurricanes and fires , the united states began a global war on terrorism . </s>  its leaders fixated on a shadowy enemy abroad as life at home crumbled for millions of americans . </s>  the war on terrorism did not end terrorism ; the war itself became endless . </s>  what it did shatter was the myth that a triumphant united states could bend the world to its will . </s>  but the myth may be roaring back , albeit in a less righteous , more vicious guise . </s>  though the new enemy is a virus , even less susceptible to verbal and physical firepower than terrorists , the trump administration appears to be setting its target on a foreign power : china , where the outbreak appears to have started but which is hardly responsible for the united states being the most infected country in the world . </s>  as the pandemic spread in the united states in march , president trump began to castigate beijing for failing to contain and report on “ the chinese virus. ” now secretary of state mike pompeo is declaring that there is “ a significant amount of evidence ” that the virus originated in a chinese laboratory , though he has provided no proof . </s>  the accusation , although doubted by scientists and intelligence agencies , may lead the public to blame china for the pandemic , much as the george w. bush administration , through suggestion more than outright lies , convinced seven in 10 americans in 2003 that saddam hussein of iraq was likely involved in the sept. 11 attacks . </s>  going abroad in search of monsters to destroy wo n't save americans from pandemics , but it does risk entangling the united states in a cold war with the world ’ s no . </s>  2 power . </s>  we stand on the brink of an even more destructive and less justifiable mistake than the post-sept. 11 crusade . </s>  on one level , the administration ’ s gambit looks like classically trumpian bluster . </s>  seizing on a grain of truth — china , at a minimum , covered up evidence of the outbreak and was too slow in sharing complete information with international health authorities — mr. trump seeks to avoid responsibility for a pandemic that the white house was slower still to take seriously . </s>  even if it walks back its most extravagant claims , the administration could acquire a cudgel for the november election . </s>  the largest pro-trump pac is already calling joe biden “ beijing biden , ” laying a trap for him to either defend china or bash it harder than mr. trump . </s>  either way suits the president . </s>  blaming china also emanates from mr. trump ’ s punitive vision of world affairs . </s>  having vowed to turn the tables on an array of foreigners supposedly exploiting the united states , the trump administration is now considering demanding reparations from china and suspending its sovereign immunity to allow it to be sued for virus-related deaths . </s>  such measures would invite swift retaliation and untold lawsuits against the united states . </s>  they would also undermine the cooperation needed to develop and manufacture coronavirus treatments , to say nothing of worsening the economy . </s>  the larger danger , however , goes beyond president trump and predates the pandemic . </s>  in recent years , china hawks have cited a cocktail of geopolitical fears , economic grievances and human rights violations as causes for alarm , leading some obama administration veterans to arrive at the expansive conclusion that engagement with beijing had failed . </s>  while balking at mr. trump ’ s trade war , much of the bipartisan establishment embraced his administration ’ s notion , laid out in the 2017 national security strategy , that china is a threat requiring a strategy of full-spectrum competition . </s>  last summer , several scholars warned that a “ new cold war ” between the superpowers could plunge the world into an intense military rivalry and thwart necessary cooperation against planetary threats like global warming , disease and deprivation . </s>  then , in the autumn , the powers stepped back from the brink . </s>  mr. trump himself seemed more interested in making a trade deal than pursuing a geopolitical struggle . </s>  the american public had bigger worries than the china peril . </s>  in the presidential primaries , democratic candidates talked more about ending interminable conflicts and tackling climate change than confronting china . </s>  but now the pandemic may be resurrecting the cold war . </s>  democrats , and republicans who truly put american security first , face a choice . </s>  joe biden in particular will decide whether to lead his party into mr. trump ’ s trap or play a different game . </s>  attempting to out-hawk far-right hawks failed democrats in the war on terrorism , leaving mr. biden with the stain of having supported the iraq war . </s>  more important , a bipartisan addiction to military action and fearmongering failed the country . </s>  mr. biden now has the opportunity to show he learned from past mistakes by speaking out against an unnecessary cold war with a power strong enough to endanger americans ’ security and well-being . </s>  decades from today , the pandemic should be remembered as the crucible of effective international cooperation against 21st-century threats . </s>  so far , it looks more like we are choosing to make the threats worse and create new perils . </s>  rachel esplin odell ( @ resplinodell ) is a research fellow at the quincy institute for responsible statecraft and an international security fellow at the belfer center for

. </s>    the united states olympic and paralympic committee is urging that the summer olympics in tokyo be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic , adding its large and influential voice to a growing chorus of athletes and sports federations objecting to having the games go on as scheduled in late july and early august . </s>  the international olympic committee said sunday it would make a decision on postponing or otherwise altering the games within four weeks . </s>  but that timeline has been met with skepticism and derision , with canada ’ s olympic committee saying it would not send its athletes this summer and the australia committee telling its athletes to plan for an olympics in 2021 . </s>  surveys of athletes are showing that most favor a postponement , because it has become increasingly difficult to train as countries impose broad restrictions on movement and shut down gyms and other facilities . </s>  the united states committee , representing the largest delegation of athletes at the games , said in a statement monday night from its chair , susanne lyons , and its chief executive , sarah hirshland , that it had made the decision after reviewing a survey that yielded responses from 1,780 american athletes . </s>  “ our most important conclusion from this broad athlete response is that even if the current significant health concerns could be alleviated by late summer , the enormous disruptions to the training environment , doping controls and qualification process can ’ t be overcome in a satisfactory manner , ’ ’ the statement said . </s>  “ to that end , it ’ s more clear than ever that the path toward postponement is the most promising , and we encourage the i.o.c . </s>  to take all needed steps to ensure the games can be conducted under safe and fair conditions for all competitors. ” with the united states urging a postponement , pressure is likely to increase on the i.o.c . </s>  to act soon . </s>  already , athletes , medical experts and others involved in the sporting world are pressing for a quicker end to the uncertainty . </s>  for medical experts and governments throughout the world , a firm decision to postpone would allow them to focus on the more immediate worry — containing the pandemic — rather than the games themselves . </s>  for athletes , many of whom have pushed for a postponement , a decision now would take away the pressure of seeking ways to train in a time of social distancing . </s>  u.s.a . </s>  gymnastics on monday also joined the calls for a postponement , following similar stances by national leaders in swimming and track and field . </s>  the three sports typically combine to deliver the most medals for the united states each summer olympics . </s>  li li leung , the chief executive of u.s.a . </s>  gymnastics , said her federation ’ s decision was based on an anonymous survey of its athletes , in which nearly two-thirds of respondents said they favored delaying the games for at least three months . </s>  “ it was really important for us to make sure our athletes ’ voices were heard in this , ” leung told reporters during a conference call , adding that the athletes wanted to compete fairly without posing a health risk to others . </s>  the i.o.c . </s>  and tokyo need their decision to come in a way that resolves billions of dollars in financial implications . </s>  “ the bottom line is if the i.o.c . </s>  or tokyo unilaterally decide to cancel or postpone without agreement , they would be in breach of contract and the potential financial repercussions are just enormous , ” said john mehrzad , a british sports lawyer who has represented national and international sports federations and athletes in litigation . </s>  “ as every day goes by and they don ’ t make a decision and other countries pull athletes out and the result of that means they can ’ t go ahead , then both parties will be delighted because it wouldn ’ t be their fault , ” mehrzad said . </s>  “ if people try to sue them , they can blame factors out of control for why it isn ’ t taking place. ” a firm decision may come soon enough ; richard w. pound ,

i.o.c. , is not a part of the executive committee that would make the final decision on how to move _forward , or a part of the other groups that have coordinated the tokyo games or the olympic response to the coronavirus threat . </s>  olympic leaders in canada , australia and norway said their athletes would not participate even if the tokyo games were held as originally scheduled . </s>  the governing body for track and field wrote to thomas bach , the i.o.c . </s>  president , calling for a delay . </s>  and in japan , where politicians and local organizers had resisted any changes to plans that represent years of work and billions of dollars in investments , leaders began to acknowledge the reality of a delay . </s>  yoshiro mori , the president of the local organizing committee , described a postponement as “ inevitable ” and said that organizers were not “ stupid enough to ignore ” the sentiments being expressed by athletes and a growing number of national olympic committees . </s>  mori said four weeks was a “ short time ” to get everything needed in order . </s>  “ it requires a tremendous amount of time and we have to hurry to go through this , ” he said . </s>  prime minister shinzo abe , for whom the tokyo games are as defining as the sochi olympics in 2014 were for president vladimir putin of russia , told parliament on monday that the country “ may have no option but to consider postponing the games. ” abe said he hoped a decision could be made quickly . </s>  the general sentiment in japan appears to support a delay . </s>  a recent poll conducted by the japanese news agency kyodo revealed almost 70 percent of people did not expect the olympics to open as billed on july 24 . </s>  bach laid out the i.o.c. ’ s timeline after an

deeply regret it , ” said gostin , the director of the o ’ neill institute for national and global health law at georgetown . </s>  the institute gives technical and strategic support to the w.h.o . </s>  in the united states . </s>  rescheduling an event as gargantuan as the games — essentially a series of more than 30 world championships — is hardly an easy task . </s>  shifting requires navigating a thicket of financial obligations that have taken years to construct and will be complicated to unwind and then carry _forward . </s>  for example , the olympic village , which was expected to host some 17,000 athletes , coaches and support staff during the games , is scheduled to be converted into permanent housing afterward . </s>  most of the units have been sold , meaning a postponement would require thousands of contracts and leases to be redone . </s>  the i.o.c . </s>  also has hundreds of deals with broadcasters and sponsors , many of whom are suffering with the collapse of world markets and are likely to seek a reduction in what they pay to televise the olympics . </s>  while the i.o.c . </s>  does have insurance , it ’ s not yet clear what losses would be covered and what an insurance company might argue would fall outside the policy , which would produce even more litigation . </s>  mehrzad , the sports lawyer , said the i.o.c . </s>  and tokyo needed to be aligned , at the very least , because canceling without a mutual agreement would put the deciders in breach of contract . </s>  “ commercial partners will have little leverage if the organizers can say the olympics have been frustrated in their efforts to host the olympics , ” mehrzad said . </s>  nbc sports , which televises the games in the united states and is one of the i.o.c. ’ s

health officials with whom they are working regarding the tokyo olympics , ” nbc sports said . </s>  athletes have become increasingly direct in their criticisms of the i.o.c . </s>  and bach . </s>  “ does this mean that athletes face up to another four weeks of finding ways to fit in training — whilst potentially putting ourselves , coaches , support staff and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway , ” the british sprinter dina asher-smith said on twitter . </s>  max hartung , a german fencer who was in isolation with his girlfriend at home , recently said

there needs to be careful planning , but me , personally , i would wish for them to take a decision sooner rather than later. ” brendan schwab , the executive director of the world players association , an umbrella body for player unions worldwide , said athletes have been simply unable to train and organizers have a responsibility to not make responding to the pandemic more difficult . </s>  “ it

that he ought to get rid of 75 to 80 percent of them — reserving the privilege only for those he liked — it may have been chilling , but it wasn ’ t surprising . </s>  he wants to thin out their ranks

angela merkel of germany , whose addresses appear with english subtitles on deutsche welle . </s>  they should start following the many civic-minded epidemiologists and virologists and contagion experts on twitter , like harvard ’ s marc lipsitch and yale ’ s nicholas christakis , whose threads have been invaluable primers in a time of awful confusion . </s>  these are people with a high tolerance for uncertainty . </s>  it ’ s the president ’ s incapacity to tolerate it — combined with his bottomless need to self-flatter and preserve his political power — that leads , so often , to his spectacular fits of deception and misdirection . </s>  at his thursday news conference , a discussion of chloroquine and other experimental therapies formed the core of his remarks , when those drugs and therapies are untested and unproven and , in some cases , won ’ t be ready for several months , as nbc ’ s peter alexander pointed out the following day . </s>  “ what do you say to

blame me , ” he said . </s>  “ there is no one else who is responsible for this decision. ” cuomo is nothing if not politically shrewd . </s>  he knows full well how this comment compares to mr. trump

tailored to the base : we ’ re keeping brown immigrants from spreading it . ) </s>  how about orwellian doublespeak ? </s>  ooooooh , check . </s>  trump and his team are continually deploying words and phrases that disguise a reality that suggests the opposite . </s>  vice president mike pence talks about a “ strong and seamless ” partnership with the states , when at the same time mr. trump is trolling the states , telling cuomo to get his own respirators . </s>  pence speaks relentlessly of a “ whole-of-government approach , ” when in fact the government is hollowed out — defunded to fight pandemics , denuded of experts — and broken in shards , with the centers for disease control and prevention sidelined in this fight , and the president ’ s task force now mutely competing with a shadow group run by the president ’ s son-in-law . </s>  on friday , trump said he cherished journalism , and his secretary of state complained about disinformation on twitter . </s>  there are simply too many two-plus-two-is-five moments to count . </s>  but most dangerous of all is trump ’ s insistence that things are fine , or will be shortly , that they ’ ll be stronger and better and greater than ever . </s>  we don ’ t have any evidence that this is true , and the president finds any suggestion to the contrary quite rude . </s>  when a journalist pointed out to him on thursday that the economy had all but ground to a halt , trump cut him off . </s>  “ what ’ s the rest of your question ? ” he snapped . </s>  “ we know that . </s>  everybody in the room knows that. ” here ’ s the truth : things might be hard — unfathomably hard — for months , perhaps even north of a year . </s>  anyone who ’ s reading or listening to other sources of news besides the president knows that . </s>  it takes sensitivity and strength and intelligence to speak truthfully to the public about imminent hardship , the prospect of enduring pain . </s>  so i listen to justin trudeau , a sci-fi

million people have died . </s>  a timeline of the events that led to these numbers may help you understand how we got here . </s>  ms . </s>  bond reassigned the case to a senior infectious disease nurse , who re-interviewed the woman and found out that she wasn ’ t quite sure when the symptoms began . </s>  they tracked back through her calendars and memories to see whom they should call to warn of possible exposure , even if it was months ago . </s>  several health workers said contact tracing is an art as much as a science . </s>  the first step is to develop rapport with the person being interviewed , so they feel comfortable giving details about their health and lives . </s>  in a city with a large immigrant population like paterson , language skills are important , as is familiarity with the community . </s>  much of an interview can be spent providing health advice to families about how to isolate in small , crowded homes and when to seek medical attention . </s>  because of the statewide stay-at-home order , most new virus patients in paterson have only been in close contact with family , extended family and sometimes co-workers . </s>  that will change once restrictions are eased , making contact tracing even harder . </s>  after gathering the list of contacts , the case investigator then hands most cases off to a support staff of 20 other workers , who call each contact , tell them they have been exposed and ask them to self-quarantine for two weeks from the date of exposure . </s>  the monitors do daily check-ins with all the contacts and the original patient during quarantine to see how they are feeling and monitor their compliance . </s>  paterson ’ s tracing efforts have been aided by new jersey ’ s electronic communicable disease tracking system , which has been serving as the master database for all cases and contacts . </s>  that system pings ms. bond ’ s phone throughout the day with new cases . </s>  a $ 95,000 state grant last year to train several dozen health workers in communicable disease investigation also helped , dr. persaud said . </s>  at the time , his main concern was that the city could have been swamped by a food-borne illness , because it is home to several large catering halls . </s>  but the program also has limitations . </s>  the team only calls contacts who live in paterson . </s>  they aren ’ t sure other localities will follow up on cases . </s>  only symptomatic patients have been tested until recently . </s>  and test results sometimes take days to show up in the system , giving the virus a big head start . </s>  statewide , dr. halkitis said , coronavirus contact tracing has been haphazard and inconsistent . </s>  “ you have places like paterson that have really revved up ; newark , which has begun training ; and local health departments that haven ’ t really begun , ” he said . </s>  in the absence of a coordinated federal response , he said , the state ’ s new community contact tracing corps will attempt to standardize training and protocols so fewer cases fall through the cracks . </s>  in paterson , the work has gone on through nights and weekends , and the tracers said it can be tedious and emotionally grueling . </s>  the goal may be to get information from each patient , but just as vital , the tracers said , is to develop enough trust so that their advice is followed . </s>  “ usually , i start the call by saying , ‘ i see you had a covid test , can you tell me why you went ? ’ ” ms. bertolero said . </s>  “ one woman said to me , ‘ because my brother

opening night delayed until july 14 , while the bbc proms , the huge music event in london , said it would decide in may about the viability of this year ’ s performances . </s>    the federal coronavirus relief packages were less effective than they could have been because they ignored the ways that the pandemic would inevitably harm some communities more than others . </s>  we must do better . </s>  before doling out any money , we propose that governments at the local , state and federal levels , as well as philanthropies , analyze the impact the funding would have on women , men , boys , girls and nonbinary people across race and class and other social identities . </s>  then they should ensure the money is allocated in a way that alleviates inequality , rather than reproduces it . </s>  our idea , a gender- and racial-equity-budget assessment , grows out of similar efforts adopted at beijing ’ s women ’ s conference 25 years ago . </s>  we need this analysis now more than ever as our country is faced with the desperate task of saving lives and livelihoods . </s>  let ’ s take one example where such an assessment would have helped . </s>  the cares act allows small businesses to receive loans , a provision that ’ s gender- and race-neutral on its face . </s>  however , only 12 percent of the black and latino owners in a survey who applied for aid reported receiving what they had asked for . </s>  that ’ s partly because many black- or latino-owned businesses do not have relationships with banks , making it nearly impossible for them to benefit from this program . </s>  similarly , while businesses owned by women of color grew faster than any other last year , they are the least likely to be able to float and wait to obtain said relief funds without their businesses closing . </s>  the assessment would have taken these factors into consideration by providing dedicated funding opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses , and within that funding pool , for women of color-owned businesses . </s>  like our societies , budgets are neither gender-neutral or race-neutral . </s>  budgets tell us whose lives matter and whose do not . </s>  that is why in the 1990s , feminists in south africa demanded that their new democracy , emerging from decades of apartheid , include a women ’ s budget . </s>  they argued that every item of income and expenditure in the government ’ s budget be examined for the differential impact it had on men and women across race and class . </s>  although the women ’ s budget has never been implemented to its full potential , one of its biggest victories was a narrative shift , according to pregs govender , a member of parliament with the african national congress who introduced the idea at the budget debate in 1994 . </s>  “ throughout the country , people are talking about women and the budget in a way that you never heard before we started this , ” she said in an interview in 2002 . </s>  the initiative made visible that those who suffered the most under apartheid — rural black women — were also the leaders most needed to build a successful democracy . </s>  we should follow south africa ’ s example . </s>  while it might seem improbable that this administration would adopt such a strategy , iceland , the netherlands , canada , mexico and other nations have already done so as of 2016 . </s>  consider its impact : in 2015 , iceland abandoned a legislative proposal to simplify the income tax system after a gender analysis revealed it would have inadvertently widened the income gap . </s>  in mexico , gender budgeting has resulted in funding targeted toward diseases affecting women , like cervical , ovarian and breast cancer . </s>  closer to home , such budgeting practices have taken place on the local level . </s>  the department of public works in san francisco reported in 2012 that it hired more female engineers after a gender analysis showed the department hired women for mostly clerical and office positions . </s>  even more promising , hawaii has proposed a feminist economic recovery response to the coronavirus that addresses the health and financial independence of those most suffering under inequality , especially native hawaiian and immigrant women . </s>  philanthropy should also implement such an approach . </s>  as a former foundation executive director who is white ( ms. shifman ) and a nonprofit leader who is black ( ms. tillet ) , we have seen again and again the ways in which women of color are passed over for funding , in favor of most everyone else . </s>  in general , nonprofit organizations led by blacks and latinos receive less funding than peer organizations with white leaders . </s>  this disparity is not a result of effectiveness . </s>  in fact the inverse is true . </s>  women of color are leading some of the most critical and transformative social justice organizations in the country often on shoestring budgets and most certainly without the social capital of white-led nonprofits . </s>  a pervasive example of this vicious cycle is when grant size is tied to budget size and not impact or potential for impact , compounding historical underinvestment in the leadership of women of color . </s>  a racial and gender-equity assessment would help grant makers break that cycle and propose larger grants to account for past discrimination — even if that means disregarding the common practice in which foundations provide no more than 20 percent of an organization ’ s overall budget . </s>  some might argue that this analysis will be unduly burdensome or costly . </s>  however , not doing this is much more costly in the long run . </s>  this is the first of many steps to recognize that those who have been pushed to the far and fatal margins of our society are the most important members of our democratic future . </s>  pamela shifman ( @ pamelashifman ) was the executive director of

yards from a stranger holding a double bass . </s>  she sat in silence for a minute , trying to hold his gaze . </s>  it was hard looking him in the eye . </s>  she ’ d spent weeks staring at screens , largely in isolation . </s>  human contact felt intense , strange . </s>  after 30 or 40 seconds , she glanced away . </s>  but then the musician raised his bow . </s>  the air began to hum with the deep chords of the instrument . </s>  she began to relax . </s>  he had picked a version of an english folk song — an adaptation of “ greensleeves . ” she realized what it was , and its origins . </s>  in her reverie , it felt like an homage to her time in england , where she had spent part of her life . </s>  she suddenly felt overwhelmed . </s>  during two months of lockdown , her amateur choir practices had been canceled . </s>  a concert she ’ d planned to see had been postponed . </s>  but here on a hill above stuttgart , a virtuoso musician was playing a piece — and only claudia brusdeylins , a 55-year-old publicist for a renewable energy research group , could hear it . </s>  “ i just felt recognized , ” ms. brusdeylins said later . </s>  to circumvent the restrictions enforced on society by the pandemic , cultural institutions have mostly turned to the internet . </s>  museums have held online panels , theaters have streamed plays on their websites , and orchestras have uploaded their back catalogs . </s>  others held drive-in events . </s>  actors in the czech republic performed to cars in a parking lot , as did musicians and djs in germany . </s>  and as the lockdown eases , a few are beginning to hold concerts in concert halls again , with large gaps between members of the audience . </s>  but two state-funded orchestras in stuttgart — the stuttgart state orchestra and the southwest german radio symphony orchestra — are trying to do something more personal . </s>  something that won ’ t keep people separated by windshields , or sitting in a mostly empty auditorium , or staring at their computer screens . </s>  something that might stir some raw emotion . </s>  the challenge was to achieve this without risking infection . </s>  the solution is an ongoing series of one-on-one concerts — in which one orchestra member plays for one audience member , without ever speaking to them . </s>  after applying to attend online , concertgoers are then allocated a 10-minute slot in one of 27 sites around the city . </s>  they include stuttgart ’ s deserted airport , an art gallery , the garden of a private villa — and the terrace beside the vineyard , where ms. brusdeylins heard the rendition of “ greensleeves. ” the audience of one arrives with no knowledge about the music that awaits him or her , or the performer or instrument that will provide it . </s>  the person simply is asked to sit down opposite the musician , and to lock eyes with the player for 60 seconds . </s>  then the musician plays for 10 minutes — sometimes squeezing in two or three pieces . </s>  they tend to arrive having rehearsed a handful of potential pieces , but change the final selection for each performance . </s>  ms. brusdeylins was subsequently treated to part of bach ’ s cello suite no . </s>  1 . </s>  finally , the concertgoer stands up and leaves without applauding , usually wordlessly . </s>  there is no ticket fee , but attendees can donate instead to a fund for freelance musicians left without an income by the crisis . </s>  the idea of a one-on-one concert was previewed last summer , at another german music festival , the volkenroda summer concerts . </s>  the organizers of that festival had themselves been inspired by a performance art project by marina abramovic , the serbian-american conceptual artist known for sitting opposite spectators at her exhibitions , and silently holding their gaze . </s>  after the lockdown began , the volkenroda ’ s organizers suggested to the stuttgart orchestras that the format was a perfect way of keeping active during the lockdown , without resorting to the internet . </s>  the result has been an intense series of more than 1,100 encounters — first in stuttgart , and now in five other german cities . </s>  and what began as a clever adaptation to coronavirus rules has since become something more profound — a means of establishing human connection , agency and meaning at a time when such concepts have been harder to foster . </s>  people often emerge nearly punch-drunk from the concerts , dazed after experiencing such a direct interaction with an artist , and with art . </s>  at the vineyard , one woman left her concert feeling as if she knew manuel schattel , the double-bassist . </s>  breaking with the rules of the format , she had spontaneously thanked him — and found herself addressing him as “ du , ” in german an informal version of “ you , ” rather than the more formal version , “ sie. ” it ’ s common for people to feel deluged by emotion , said stephanie winker , a juilliard-trained flutist who created the format , and who remains one of the performers . </s>  “ we are craving contact at this point ; we have all been staring at screens for hours and hours , ” ms. winker said . </s>  “ you forget that staring into people ’ s eyes for a long time is incredibly powerful. ” it ’ s often an overwhelming experience for the musicians , too . </s>  for mr. schattel , it has been a revelation to finally play for an audience , after weeks of playing at home only for himself . </s>  “ you need an audience to really express what you feel , ” he said , after performing for ms. brusdeylins . </s>  “ this made me feel free again — like the world is turning ” once more . </s>  and it ’ s moving to see a stranger for the first time , he said , to make that direct eye contact , and to decide what to play based on those initial impressions of who that person is . </s>  and then to play for them , and them alone . </s>  when mr. schattel played for ms. brusdeylins , he didn ’ t actually tailor his set in homage to her life story ; he hadn ’ t known of her time in england . </s>  but she was right to feel that he ’ d consciously chosen “ greensleeves. ” he could immediately tell she was nervous , he remembered later . </s>  and “ greensleeves , ” he felt , was the perfect melody to put her at her ease . </s>  “ i thought this would lift her up and take her by the hand , ” mr. schattel said . </s>  “ this would invite her to come with me . ” </s>    california has been in a standoff with the ride-hailing companies uber and lyft over their drivers ’ status under the law : whether they are contractors or employees . </s>  now the coronavirus crisis has put a spotlight on a related question : who is responsible for helping those drivers when there is no work ? </s>  the companies are urging their drivers nationwide to apply for emergency unemployment benefits that federal legislation established last month for the self-employed . </s>  but there ’ s a catch in california : the state doesn ’ t typically consider them self-employed . </s>  nonetheless , gov . </s>  gavin newsom signed an executive order on wednesday directing the state ’ s unemployment agency to help workers like uber and lyft drivers collect benefits under the federal program , known as pandemic unemployment assistance . </s>  that may put the state at odds with the rules of the federal program . </s>  u.s. labor department officials have emphasized that only workers ineligible for traditional unemployment benefits can receive the federal pandemic assistance . </s>  and under a state law passed last year and some previous determinations , the drivers are considered employees in california and should be able to draw traditional unemployment benefits . </s>  recourse to such assistance has been hampered , however , by the companies ’ refusal to provide routine documentation to the state as they fight the law in court . </s>  the circumstances effectively forced the state to provide unemployment assistance to drivers that they may not be legally entitled to receive , employment experts said . </s>  “ the states are caught in a hard place , ” said brian chen , a lawyer who focuses on the rights of economically insecure workers at the national employment law project , an advocacy group . </s>  “ they ’ re trying to do the right thing . </s>  but this is what happens when ultrapowerful app companies with an army of well-paid lobbyists and lawyers are saying they ’ re going to fight to the bitter end against workers ’ ability to demand rights under the law. ” the california labor secretary , julie a. su , said in an interview that she believed the state ’ s move to help drivers under the federal program was legal because the government had “ emphasized flexibility ” in administering the emergency aid . </s>  the u.s. labor department did not provide comment for this article . </s>  allowing drivers to receive the new federal benefits rather than traditional unemployment assistance could help gig-economy companies like uber and lyft avoid significant costs in the future . </s>  employers in california and other states are required to contribute to state unemployment trust funds on behalf of employees who might claim benefits . </s>  while employers are not required to make contributions to fund pandemic-related claims , they will have to make contributions after the crisis . </s>  in effect , allowing the drivers to claim the federal benefit helps the companies avoid conceding that they are on the hook for funding state benefits . </s>  an uber spokesman said , “ congress fully funded pandemic unemployment assistance for gig workers so that every state , many of which face historic deficits , could give these workers immediate financial support at no cost to their own funds. ” uber has also pointed out that the state ’ s recent law doesn ’ t make drivers eligible for unemployment benefits on its own . </s>  it creates a test that state agencies must apply before granting benefits , and which they have yet to do in many drivers ’ cases . </s>  most experts believe that drivers will be deemed employees under the test . </s>  lyft declined to comment for this article . </s>  california ’ s action appears to reflect a shift by state officials . </s>  early this month , the state seemed to be trying to process benefits for uber and lyft drivers under the traditional unemployment system . </s>  on a website listing frequently asked questions by workers applying for benefits during the pandemic , it instructed gig workers to “ list your gig employer as your last employer. ” workers who have employers would typically be eligible for traditional unemployment benefits and therefore ineligible for federal pandemic assistance for the self-employed . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates updated jan. 27 , 2021 , 8:53 p.m

unemployment insurance to remove that sentence from its website and to help gig workers apply for pandemic unemployment assistance . </s>  “ many self-employed ride-share and delivery drivers intend to apply for loans and other federal relief available to independent contractors , ” the companies wrote , and they “ worry that making an inaccurate representation that they are employees ” could preclude that , the email said . </s>  ms. su , the state labor secretary , said the purpose of the new approach was to ensure that struggling gig workers could begin to receive benefits rapidly . </s>  while some uber and lyft drivers had successfully claimed regular unemployment benefits in california before the executive order , the process took months because the companies refused to submit

california to desist but that it was unlikely to require the state to pay back money it had given to drivers . </s>  states are sometimes tempted to push boundaries because the labor department “ hasn ’ t always stood up to them , ” mr. stettner added . </s>  “ it ’ s not a very aggressive oversight agency. ” some groups , like the california labor federation , had pressed the state to expedite traditional unemployment benefits for gig workers , an approach that experts like mr. stettner said they believed the state could take . </s>  but ms. su said there was no way to expedite unemployment benefits for drivers under the traditional program without income data from uber and lyft . </s>  by contrast , under the rules of the pandemic assistance program , the self-employed and other eligible workers can begin receiving assistance quickly , even before documenting their income . </s>  ms. su said that she had spoken with representatives from uber and lyft about the state ’ s approach but that the companies did not directly make the case for the action the state took . </s>  in addition to california , at least three states — illinois , new york and new jersey — have deemed at least some uber and lyft drivers eligible for regular unemployment insurance . </s>  but uber and lyft are contesting these decisions in many states and are not paying into the state unemployment insurance funds . </s>  if drivers in these states receive federal pandemic assistance rather than traditional unemployment benefits , it could help reduce the financial liabilities of companies like uber and lyft by tens of millions of dollars after the crisis passes . </s>  mr. newsom did take some steps at odds with the positions of uber and lyft . </s>  his executive order made clear that the state law effectively requiring gig companies to classify drivers as employees still applied , entitling drivers to all protections of employment , like minimum-wage rules , overtime pay , workers ’ compensation and paid sick leave . </s>  he also said that the companies must hand over income data for their drivers , though it was unclear how he planned to enforce that demand . </s>  “ we don ’ t take any enforcement options off the table , ” ms. su said when asked about the possibility of litigation . </s>    washington — speaker nancy pelosi , moving aggressively to scrutinize the trump administration ’ s handling of the coronavirus pandemic , said thursday that she would seek to create a special bipartisan committee to oversee all aspects of the government ’ s response , including how it distributes more than $ 2 trillion in emergency aid . </s>  the announcement , which drew immediate objections from president trump and the top house republican , came as leaders were struggling to determine how congress could perform its most basic functions — both legislating and acting as a check on a president who has consistently stonewalled attempts at oversight — when lawmakers were scattered around the country with the capitol shuttered . </s>  the plan to create a select committee , which would require a house vote , reflects a particular sense of urgency among democrats to keep a close watch on how mr. trump carries out the more than $ 2 trillion stimulus package that he signed into law last week . </s>  the measure created vast programs , including a $ 500 billion corporate bailout program and a $ 350 billion small-business loan initiative , and provided $ 150 million for states and cities coping with the coronavirus . </s>  democrats insisted on attaching strict oversight measures to the bailout money , but mr. trump — who was impeached last year on charges of abuse of power and obstructing congressional attempts to investigate — has suggested he has the authority to decide whether an inspector general appointed to oversee it has to share information with congress . </s>  “ where there is money , there is often frequently mischief , ” ms. pelosi told reporters on thursday during a telephonic news conference to replace her usual weekly briefing on capitol hill , another tradition upended by social distancing . </s>  ms. pelosi said the panel would have subpoena power , meaning it could demand testimony and documents from the trump administration . </s>  that raised the prospect of a new round of constitutional showdowns between mr. trump and the democrat-led house over information about how the administration addressed the coronavirus threat , and its actions as the disease began rampaging across the country . </s>  at the white house , mr. trump reacted angrily to the idea of a special committee , criticizing democrats for “ conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic. ” “ i want to remind everyone here in our nation ’ s capital , especially in congress , that this is not the time for politics , endless partisan investigations — here we go again , ” he said . </s>  “ it ’ s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt. ” already on thursday , democrats were questioning the enactment of a $ 100 billion worker relief package passed last month after the labor department issued guidance that gave wide latitude for businesses with 50 or fewer employees to decline to offer the paid leave benefit included in the law . </s>  congress worked with remarkable speed and bipartisanship to pass the stimulus package , as the senate remained in session — even as some of its members fell ill — and more than 200 house members returned to washington to vote . </s>  but leaders of both parties concede that the road ahead will be even more challenging with much of the country on lockdown and lawmakers gone for the foreseeable future . </s>  representative steny h. hoyer , democrat of maryland and the majority leader , said in an interview thursday that lawmakers are “ just in the very first stages of figuring out ” how they would operate in the coming days .

he previously dismissed as setting “ a bad precedent. ” “ circumstances have made it clear , ” mr. hoyer said , that remote voting must be considered . </s>  “ 9/11 raised the specter of members not

education and health care . </s>  mr. hoyer acknowledged that there were a string of unanswered questions , including whether committees would meet by teleconference and how the public — accustomed to watching deliberations on c-span — would be able to observe lawmakers conducting the nation ’ s business when most of the work was being done on private conference calls . </s>  already , some committees are making adjustments . </s>  the senate armed services committee , which is working on the bill that sets policy for the nation ’ s military , has developed a process it calls “ paper hearings , ” in which committee members will post questions to the pentagon on the panel ’ s website and officials will have one week to answer them . </s>  gone will be the spontaneous back-and-forth of hearings in person . </s>  the appropriations committees , which control all government spending , are adamant that they still work to meet their own deadlines with staff members working remotely with federal agencies to sort out their funding needs . </s>  before the outbreak , house leaders had set a goal of finishing their versions of the 12 spending bills by the end of june , but it is unclear if the body would even be able to meet to vote then if they were complete . </s>  “ we haven ’ t passed appropriations bills , we have the defense authorization bill and who knows what else might come up , either in the united states or around the world , ” representative jim mcgovern , democrat of massachusetts and the chairman of the rules committee , said in an interview . </s>  “ i think we need to make it clear to the administration that congress is not closed. ” oversight of regular government functions might prove more difficult , particularly when much of lawmakers ’ time will be consumed by the response to the pandemic . </s>  ms. pelosi said the new committee would be led by one of her top deputies , representative james e. clyburn , democrat of south carolina and the majority whip , and would have an expert staff to search for waste , fraud and abuse . </s>  the speaker also lent her support to an independent , nonpartisan after-action investigation like the commission that investigated the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , but said that would have to come later . </s>  but representative kevin mccarthy , republican of california and the minority leader ,

appearance before congress since president trump declared a national emergency in march , and a chance for him to address lawmakers and the public without president trump by his side . </s>  he has been largely out of public view since last week , when mr. trump abandoned his daily briefings with his coronavirus task force . </s>  in an email to the new york times reporter sheryl gay stolberg late monday night , dr. fauci laid out what he intended to tell senators . </s>  “ the major message that i wish to convey to the senate hlp committee tomorrow is the danger of trying to open the

a “ downward trajectory of documented cases ” of coronavirus over two weeks , while conducting robust contact tracing and “ sentinel surveillance ” testing of asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations , such as nursing homes . </s>  but many states are reopening without meeting those guidelines , seeking to ease the economic pain as millions of working people and small-business owners are facing ruin while sheltering at home . </s>  “ we ’ re not reopening based on science , ” said dr. thomas r. frieden , a former director of the centers for disease control and prevention . </s>  “

everyone who enters the west wing to wear a mask or face covering , ” read the memo , which was distributed to staff members through the white house management office . </s>  the new guidance is an abrupt establishment of a policy after two aides working near the president — a military valet and katie miller , the vice president ’ s spokeswoman — tested positive for the coronavirus last week . </s>  the new rules are not expected to apply to president trump and vice president mike pence , who for weeks have downplayed the need to wear masks , an attitude that had trickled down to staff

mr. trump , flanked by large posters that proclaimed “ america leads the world in testing , ” announced that more tests had been completed in the united states per capita than in south korea . </s>  “ no matter how you look at it , america is leading the world in testing , ” mr. trump declared , leaving out the fact that south korea had carried out rigorous testing early and flattened its curve .

our country are dropping very substantiality , ” he said , although data compiled by the new york times shows that cases in the united states are declining slightly , not substantially , and are growing in some areas . </s>  more than 20,000 new cases have been announced almost every day in recent weeks , not the sharp descent scientists had hoped for . </s>  the president was most

experience of georgia , one of the first states to allow a broad array of businesses to reopen . </s>  two weeks after georgia eased its restrictions , the number of new cases there has remained relatively steady — though experts cautioned it was still too soon to assess the public health effects . </s>  “ it ’ s kind of a wait and see , ” said andreas handel , an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the university of georgia , who estimated that people who caught the virus in the first week after reopening may only now be showing symptoms and getting tested .

</s>  president trump abruptly ended his rose garden news conference shortly after a chinese-american reporter pressed him on why he suggested she “ ask china ” in response to her question on virus

every day ? ” “ well , ” mr. trump responded , “ they ’ re losing their lives everywhere in the world , and maybe that ’ s a question you should ask china. ” ms. jiang , who had been leaning into a contact-free microphone to ask her question , lowered her face mask and paused for a couple seconds before asking , “ sir , why are you saying that to me , specifically ? ” kaitlan collins of cnn tried to ask mr. trump a question after briefly ceding her turn at the microphone to let ms. jiang follow up , but mr. trump tried to move on . </s>  after ms. collins remained at the microphone and

that showed how rosy his state ’ s financial picture was compared to those of three democratic states : california , illinois and new york . </s>  why should congress send help to struggling states

cities and towns . </s>  but republicans are divided over how much aid to provide and what conditions to place on the money . </s>  much of the dispute is being driven by the political bent of the states that stand to benefit or lose . </s>  the disagreement is another reminder that as mr. trump and a divided congress make decisions about federal relief , politics is never far from their calculations . </s>  now democrats are urging action on the next phase of assistance even as mr. trump and republicans argue that the government should wait to see how the economy is faring before enacting another sweeping stimulus law . </s>  states run by democrats and republicans alike are projecting steep drops in tax collections and weighing spending cuts . </s>  gov . </s>  gavin newsom

that businesses operating in defiance were opening themselves up to an array of penalties , from the loss of liquor licenses and health department certification to the cancellation of insurance . </s>  he also threatened to withhold funding for counties that violate the order . </s>  “ the commonwealth closed down the state in a measured , staged manner and we ’ re reopening in the same measured ,

coronavirus , which poses a severe threat as factories shut down , people lose jobs and the economy grinds to a halt while lawmakers in congress continue to struggle to find a fiscal response , making the central bank the primary line of defense . </s>  “ the speed of the response has been unprecedentedly fast , ” said roberto perli , a partner at cornerstone macro and former fed economist . </s>

aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate , ” the central bank said in a monday morning statement , an uncharacteristically blunt warning from a usually staid institution . </s>  the central bank , which restarted its giant bond-buying program eight days ago , said it would expand well beyond the “ at least ” $ 700 billion in treasury and $ 200 billion in mortgage-backed securities it initially committed to buying . </s>  instead , officials will buy bonds “ in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning ” — including buying government-backed debt tied to commercial real estate . </s>  the program , which the policy-setting federal open market committee supported unanimously , is a nod to the fact that crucial markets at the center of the financial system have struggled to function . </s>  in laying out such an explicitly unlimited package , and in creating such expansive emergency lending programs , the central bank is going far beyond its playbook from the 2008 financial crisis . </s>  as the virus has emptied out shops , airplanes

on shaky ground and cash-hungry investors unwilling to snap up outstanding corporate debt , interest rates have jumped , making it too expensive for companies to raise money by selling new bonds .

cash position . </s>  the other would purchase already-issued debt , and the fed said together the programs would “ support credit to large employers. ” fed officials are also taking measures to support smaller businesses , resurrecting a program from the 2008 financial crisis , the term asset-backed securities loan facility or talf , that encouraged lending to small businesses and households . </s>  officials also announced that they would set up a new program , the main street business lending program , that would “ support lending to eligible small-and-medium sized businesses , ” though they gave few details as to how . </s>  the three fleshed-out programs will provide “ up to $ 300 billion in new financing , ” the central bank said . </s>  republican senators have suggested creating a fund of $ 425 billion at the treasury department that the fed could use to back emergency lending facilities — which would enable such programs to grow far beyond that scale . </s>  because the fed can not take on substantial credit risk itself , the treasury department backs its emergency lending , using money from a fund that contains just $ 95 billion . </s>  treasury secretary steven mnuchin on sunday suggested that the new money in the republican bill could be leveraged by the fed to back some $ 4 trillion in financing . </s>  “ we do have limited amounts of money we ’ re using before congress passes this bill , so we ’ re not waiting on congress , ” mr. mnuchin said in an interview on cnbc on monday . </s>  “ as congress gives us the authority , we ’ ll be increasing the facilities substantially. ” yet the extra support has become a political flash-point , and one of the sticking points holding up a broader congressional relief package . </s>  democrats are worried that the fed ’ s loans would carry too few restrictions . </s>  beyond limiting companies that receive its loans and take an interest deferral from stock buybacks , the fed declined to say whether it has the legal authority to go further than that , for instance by preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers . </s>  democrats on sunday evening prevented republicans from proceeding to a vote on the fiscal bill before negotiations were complete , blocking it again on monday . </s>  in their own bill in the house , democrats instructed the fed to establish a small business lending facility . </s>  the bill would mandate the creation of a fed facility that would indirectly help people who miss mortgage payments because of the coronavirus , and another that would buy and sell municipal debt used to fund public health responses . </s>  congressional leaders and the trump administration remained locked in negotiations by monday evening . </s>  the total fiscal response could approach $ 2 trillion , including assistance for workers , corporations and small businesses , and direct payments to low- and middle-income families . </s>  the fed ’ s announcements came early on monday as markets braced for a tumultuous day . </s>  traders remained cautious about the central bank ’ s ability to shift the economy ’ s trajectory , and stocks sank throughout the day , with the s & p 500

strategy at td securities . </s>  she pointed out that in the markets the fed was trying to soothe — especially that for mortgage debt — conditions did improve . </s>  “ the fed facilities worked through the market today , ” she said . </s>  “ the problem is that we ’ re headed into a recession — and a pretty deep one. ” the fed has been acting almost daily as the coronavirus spreads , shutting down huge swaths of the united states and global economy and threatening to plunge the world into a major downturn . </s>  the central bank slashed interest rates to near-zero just over a week ago . </s>  in the days since , it ramped up the size of its liquidity injections — meant to keep the market for short-term loans between banks functioning normally — and announced several other emergency lending programs . </s>  it is buying commercial paper , a type of short-term debt companies use to fund themselves , and it has backstopped money market mutual funds , which both businesses and companies use to stash cash , including ones that invest in municipal debt . </s>  the fed ’ s overarching goal is to keep the economic shock , which is sure to be steep but which could prove short , from turning into a full-blown financial crisis that interrupts the flow of credit to businesses and households that need it . </s>  the hit to growth promises to be substantial even without the accelerant of a financial meltdown . </s>  economists at goldman sachs estimate that growth could contract by 24 percent in the second quarter while morgan stanley is projecting a 30 percent hit — which would be the worst single-quarter drop recorded in modern american economic statistics . </s>  the question is how long the virus will last — and how quickly things will bounce back after . </s>

there is a promising trend for readers who are seeking more details : we ’ ve noticed that local sites tend to offer more data over time , as testing access improves and case tallies go up . </s>  city and county representatives have been reminding us that positive case counts are based on confirmed lab testing , and that there may be many more cases in each community . </s>  a city of berkeley

jersey residents carol and david hewit were on their island packet sailboat , about a quarter mile from the dutch island of sint eustatius , when , mrs. hewit recalled , “ we were greeted as we entered their only harbor with bullhorns and boats. ” they turned around and sailed through the night to the u.s. virgin islands . </s>  now moored on francis bay in st. john , the couple , who are in their 60s , say they do not want to return home ; the new york area is now the pandemic ’ s epicenter . </s>  like many sailors , they do not want to leave their boats by flying home — if they could even get a flight out ; theirs , for later this month , has already been canceled . </s>  their son , based in midtown new york , has moved his family , including their infant grandson , into the couple ’ s home , and the hewits fear contracting the virus on the plane and passing it along . </s>  many mariners like the hewits plan to ride out the pandemic on islands , choosing what appears their safest option in an ever-changing set of unknowns . </s>  but marvin a. blyden , a territory senate leader who has drafted several pieces of legislation regarding the mariners since their arrival , worries that playing safe haven for guests will prove dangerous for residents . </s>  “ we don ’ t have the resources to deal with the large influx , ” he said . </s>  “ yes , we ’ re an american system . </s>  yes , we should look to help those in need . </s>  but at the same time we must protect our borders and we must protect our people. ” concerns over water quality sailors might seem self-sufficient if they have food , water and other supplies onboard , but waste disposal remains an urgent need . </s>  most big ports include pump-out stations , but st. john ’ s does not , so mariners must trek three miles out to sea to dump their waste . </s>  ( some have not followed the rules : there have been reports of illegal dumping , which could affect the waters across the territory . ) </s>  “ just by increasing the volume of boating , you impact the environment as a whole , ” said leigh fletcher , president of ocean systems laboratory , inc. , which conducts water-quality testing in the territory . </s>  “ we should be setting up a special program for what is now occurring. ” residents are particularly worried about the quality of beach water , which has not been tested since the end of march . </s>  ( testing in the national park is expected to start within the week , but testing of territorial waters has been suspended indefinitely , pending the local government ’ s payment of an outstanding bill . ) </s>  and many boats are farther away in areas that are never tested , the lab owners said , making it impossible to know the effects on marine ecosystems . </s>  these ecosystems are crucial to two of the territory ’ s most important industries : tourism and fishing . </s>  “ it ’ s a much longer story for us , ” said brigitte berry , a st. thomas resident who helped found the marine rebuild fund to clean the waters after two devastating back-to-back hurricanes in 2017 . </s>  “ i remember my dad fishing in that bay . </s>  he ’ s told me stories about his dad fishing in that bay , i see my nieces playing in that bay . </s>  we want generations more to fish and swim in that bay , so we get very protective of that. ” though the public beaches have been shuttered , the natural resources department issued an advisory earlier this month , warning that “ compliance with water quality standards for safe swimming or fishing at beaches territory-wide is unknown. ” moreover , overboard dumping increases the risk of viral contamination , noted amy dempsey , vice president for ocean systems . </s>  the coronavirus survives in sewage and , she said , the effect of salt water is unclear . </s>  mariners following the rules worry about coming back to a stranger at their mooring ball . </s>  stephen b. meister and his family have been moored off st. john for almost a month . </s>  they had left their home in long island for his daughter ’ s spring break , but are now working , schooling and in the case of his daughter , micaela , practicing the violin on their 70-foot yacht . </s>  one recent morning , sailing off to dump their waste , mr. meister saw a catamaran approaching his dingy , in which his wife and daughter sat , near their mooring ball . </s>  the catamaran had its boat hook extended . </s>  “ they ’ re jousting at my wife — like medieval knights , ” he recalled . </s>  “ and they ’ re arguing ‘ you can ’ t hold the mooring. ’ ” he quickly returned to claim his place , and made the 30-minute journey eight hours later when “ the coast was clear. ” now , to keep track of how many boats are entering the territory and get a better handle on contamination concerns , government officials have reinstituted monthly mooring and anchoring fees , which were temporarily suspended with the outbreak . </s>  since the fees , mr. meister confirmed that “ the mooring ball wars ” had come to an end . </s>  more and more garbage some cruisers , seeking a more secluded haven away from town , have nestled among the tree-sheltered waters of the virgin islands national park , which makes up almost two-thirds of st. john . </s>  but with the closure of the park — and the halting of garbage collection — bags of trash soon were piled around the locked barrels , concerning boaters and residents alike . </s>  some residents banded together , filling a truck bed with trash on a recent weekend . </s>  the park also quickly certified several residents — who wear masks — to help with garbage removal and grocery delivery . </s>  nate fletcher , a st. john resident and the owner of blue line yacht charters ( which has not had an onboard guest in more than a month ) , now goes twice a week , boat to boat , collecting trash . </s>  he gathered 60 bags on tuesday . </s>  “ it ’ s a big career change , ” mr. fletcher said with a laugh , adding that his boat , the poseidon , a 37-foot midnight express with three 300-horse power engines , is “ a very , very fast trash boat. ” the $ 5-a-bag charge does not yield a profit , but it allows him to stay even with his bills , while helping resolve what was “ quickly becoming a problem , ” he said . </s>  the coronavirus has arrived to combat the spread of the virus , the u.s. virgin islands have instituted shelter-at-home and social-distancing measures . </s>  restaurants and bars have closed . </s>  the virus arrived in the virgin islands in march , and by mid april , 51 covid-19 cases were reported , and two deaths , with more than a third of the cases coming from tourists or residents traveling within 14 days of displaying symptoms . </s>  local health officials project more than 20,000 infections and upward of 100 hospitalizations if people abide by the strictest measures . </s>  but with looser rules , hospitalizations would rocket up to almost 1,000 “ at any one point in time , ” dr. esther ellis , the territorial epidemiologist said by email . </s>  the islands do not have the resources to handle such an outbreak . </s>  medical professionals say the two hospitals on st. thomas and st. croix are understaffed and together have 20 intensive care unit beds and 127 ventilators . </s>  in the hopes of stymying the spread of the virus , the local government has implemented a self-reporting health questionnaire , which boaters must fill out . </s>  homeward bound ? </s>  in the crowded virgin island harbors , boaters are hearing from other mariners in the caribbean who feel stranded in more restricted waters ; these sailors are asking if they should come to the u.s. virgin islands . </s>  the governor ’ s office , which lacks the authority to close ports and airports ( this would halt food and medical imports ) , said that they would not discourage mariners from coming , but there are strict territory-wide guidelines they should follow when they arrive . </s>  richard motta jr. , the governor ’ s communications director , added that “ solely out of capacity , ” the office would prefer “ if they are to come to the territory to come to st. croix because a lot of the bays have already reached capacity at st. thomas and st. john. ” the number of boats remains high , but much of the traffic has halted in recent days , and some boats — between 100 and 150 , mr. oriol estimates — have already left . </s>  those who are staying indefinitely are up against yet another impending deadline . </s>  hurricane season begins in june . </s>  many boat owners have insurance policies requiring them to leave the caribbean by june or july . </s>  many would typically hire crew members to help with the journey back , but can not easily do so under pandemic conditions . </s>  one solution is the “ homeward bound flotilla , ” an organized departure of boats leaving every sunday for at least a month . </s>  the first nine boats left on easter . </s>  salty dawg sailing association , a nonprofit which typically organizes social boating trips , has set up resources to help the passage , waiving its typical fees . </s>  “ we just wanted to be as inclusive as possible , ” said hank george , the association ’ s president . </s>  “ we didn ’ t want anyone wandering into the ocean on their own. ” mariners joining the flotilla may access a u.s. coast guard interface , an online journey-tracker and weather updates . </s>  the salty dawg communicates with authorities and helps troubleshoot closed ports en route . </s>  approximately 160 boats have registered so far ; most are stationed in the territory and will head out over the next month . </s>  other mariners , like the hewits , plan to stay put . </s>  mr. mann , who was turned away at culebra , said he plans to leave as early as next week for the chesapeake bay , weather depending . </s>  follow new york times travel on instagram ,

buildings on 62 acres in rural sweden $ 7.2 million ( 70 million swedish krona ) a rare example of swedish village architecture is on offer in sala , a rural town in sweden ’ s vastmanland county , about 90 minutes north of stockholm . </s>  even more rare : the entire hamlet of 70 buildings , known as satra brunn , is for sale , with some of its structures dating to 1700 . </s>  operated continuously for 300 years , first as a wellness retreat and then as a holistic research and treatment center by uppsala university from 1747 to 1999 , the 62-acre village was built around a natural underground spring heralded for its therapeutic waters . </s>  the property has been owned since 2002 by a group of 15 local residents who wanted to “ preserve the unity and history ” of the village , said mats wikman , one of the shareholders . </s>  in addition to its spa operations , the site also hosts festivals and concerts . </s>  mr. wikman said that with most of the owners now in middle age , “ we need other people who can take care of it. ” a journalist who wrote a book about satra brunn , mr. wikman said that of the 10 or so similar health villages built in sweden during the 18th century , this is the only one to survive with its historical fabric mostly intact . </s>  “ despite its history , the place is not very well known outside the area , ” he said . </s>  “ in my point of view , it should be regarded as a world heritage site. ” jonas martinsson , who has this listing with residence christie ’ s international real estate , said other such properties often are redeveloped beyond recognition , but “ when you walk around satra brunn , you are following swedish culture and building history from 300 years back . </s>  all these houses have their short or long story. ” the heart of the village is a cluster of the oldest buildings , including the spring house . </s>  while some were constructed as dormitories with shared bathrooms and common rooms , others served as family cottages or more decorative homes for professors or wealthy patrons . </s>  the smallest are 1,076 square feet and the largest , the bergabo , a striking building set off by a watch tower in its frame , is nearly 5,200 square feet . </s>  mr. wikman estimated about 45 buildings — many still named for their former occupants — would be good candidates for conversion to personal homes . </s>  “ the big challenge would be to choose which houses a new owner wants to start working on , ” mr. martinsson said . </s>  most of the buildings do not have kitchens , as food was prepared and delivered from a central kitchen , but they all have plumbing and floor plans that would accommodate kitchen conversions . </s>  many houses still have original details such as wood paneling , decorative ceilings and tiles , and at least three-quarters are insulated for winter . </s>  all are timber , made from local materials , some with traditional carved porches . </s>  the mostly uniform red color is actually a natural copper and iron-ore paint sourced from local mines and applied as a preservative . </s>  the village includes a 19th-century deconsecrated church and commercial enterprises such as a conference center , restaurant , a working spa with an indoor pool , sauna and gym ; a bottling line that produces 2 million bottles of high-grade spring water a year ; and a preschool for 40 local children , operated by the municipality . </s>  the school is three years into its 25-year lease agreement , which provides operating income for the village , mr. wikman said . </s>  the buyer can choose whether to continue operating the commercial spaces . </s>  because of the covid-19 pandemic , all operations are currently suspended until the fall , though much of sweden has remained open . </s>  the municipality of sala , in south-central sweden , has about 13,000 residents and draws tourists to its historic silver mine , which dates to the 15th century . </s>  mr. martinsson said many swedes come to sala for its lakes , fresh air and bird-watching . </s>  the nearest city , vasteras , is 20 miles south . </s>  stockholm , sweden ’ s capital , is 90 minutes south by car and accessible by high-speed train . </s>  market overview mr. martinsson said sweden attracts buyers with its “ financial balance and society , ” adding that “ people come from abroad and see that we don ’ t have gated communities and it ’ s open. ” sweden ’ s housing index saw successive year-over-year gains from 2014 to 2017 before falling 3.7 percent in 2018 , the year a change in mortgage regulations required borrowers to pay off their loans faster , said pontus kopparberg , chief executive of residence christie ’ s international real estate in stockholm . </s>  after those rules were suspended , the housing index recovered , rising 3 percent from 2018 to 2019 . </s>  as of the first quarter of 2020 , the average price for a single-family home was 3.3 million krona ( $ 340,000 ) . </s>  the average price reached nearly 5.9 million krona ( $ 609,000 ) in stockholm , and 4.1 million krona ( $ 424,000 ) in malmo , sweden ’ s third-largest city , in the far south . </s>  the sale of satra brunn as an entire village makes it an anomaly on the swedish market . </s>  based on 168 sales recorded in sala in 2018 , the price for one- and two-unit dwellings averaged 2.15 million swedish krona ( $ 222,000 ) in 2018 , a 6 percent increase from 2017 , and a 46 percent jump from 2013 , according to statistics sweden . </s>  however , mr. martinsson said , “ stockholm is a more reliable market to track because in the country , housing supply and other economics often depend on large factories or other manufacturing. ” mr. kopparberg said prices for apartments in the center of stockholm average between $ 836 and $ 1,115 a square foot . </s>  in the suburbs , he estimated prices might be half that . </s>  because stockholm is a small city encompassing 14 islands in an archipelago extending to the baltic sea , most new construction occurs in the inland suburbs to the north . </s>  the city ’ s housing stock is a fairly even split of cooperative apartments , rent-controlled apartments and privately owned houses , mr. kopparberg said . </s>  condominiums make up a smaller market , often built as conversions in historic buildings such as those on strandvagen , an elegant shoreline boulevard developed for the 1897 stockholm world ’ s fair . </s>  lars fredegard , owner of the lars fredegard agency in stockholm , said he recently sold a two-bedroom apartment with about 3,121 square feet there for 60 million krona ( $ 6.2 million ) . </s>  nationally , prices for multidwelling and commercial buildings , like many on the satra brunn site , rose by 11 percent in the first quarter of 2020 from the fourth quarter of 2019 . </s>  agents agreed that low interest rates for commercial properties have boosted demand in some areas . </s>  when the coronavirus pandemic hit , sweden opted not to shut down , relying instead on voluntary compliance to control the spread . </s>  as of may 26 , the country had recorded 34,440 confirmed cases and 4,125 deaths , many more per capita than its nordic neighbors . </s>  in stockholm , agents now show properties by appointment only , and said higher-priced real estate has been mostly unaffected by the crisis . </s>  “ so far it ’ s quite normal , ” mr. fredegard said , adding that sales in january and february were strong , although now “ it ’ s moving a little bit slower. ” mr. kopparberg agreed , saying he has seen a mere 2 percent price dip . </s>  “ the prices and the turnover are about the same as last year , so it ’ s really surprising that the market is working close to normal so far , ” he said . </s>  but those who are looking are taking longer to buy , said niklas berntzon , a broker with the eklund stockholm new york agency . </s>  “ people are more concerned about their timing , are uncertain about their jobs or their companies , ” he said . </s>  “ right now they don ’ t trust themselves to make the right decision. ” andreas wallstrom , acting group chief economist at swedbank , said that although the microdata for the second quarter of 2020 “ looks bad , ” the housing sector “ will not suffer much ” during this crisis . </s>  he said prices are affected more by cost of living , disposable income and interest and mortgage rates . </s>  “ the housing market , i ’ m not too worried about in the short-term , ” mr. wallstrom said , noting that commercial real estate “ is much more dependent on how the overall economy gets along and how long this crisis will be for different sectors. ” the current weak state of the swedish krona , he said , is favorable for investors , though “ domestic forecasters expect the swedish krona to strengthen ” on the other side of the crisis . </s>  who buys in sweden in 2019 , the national statistics agency reported 37,740 vacation homes in sweden — 6.2 percent of the total — were foreign-owned , with 87 percent of those owners coming from norway , denmark and germany . </s>  real estate agents say beyond the traditional market , they have seen queries from the u.s. and , to a lesser extent , china . </s>  many foreign buyers have a connection to the country — either swedes repatriating or newcomers with swedish heritage . </s>  mr. fredegard said while the market for vacation homes in sweden is always slower between november and march , contributing to a temporary price drop , “ we notice a big demand for vacation homes in the stockholm area because people are unable to travel abroad because of the corona situation. ” in vastmanland county , which includes sala , foreign ownership makes up less than 1 percent of the available stock of vacation homes . </s>  buying basics there are no restrictions on foreign purchases in sweden , and most transactions require a 10 percent down payment . </s>  attorneys perform due diligence and execute contracts and other transaction matters , and real estate agents can handle post-purchase registrations . </s>  the process can take one to six months , depending on the complexity of the transaction . </s>  “ real estate is looked on as a safe investment , so it is generally pretty easy to get a mortgage , ” said magnus odin , a real estate attorney with lindskog malmstrom , a stockholm firm . </s>  he advised potential buyers to consult a tax lawyer for advice on whether to buy as a company or an individual . </s>  websites satra brunn

have allowed single-use n95s to be worn multiple times and cleaned using unproven decontamination methods . </s>  while elastomerics have practical challenges , like fitting and cleaning , they have failed to catch on largely because of their industrial look and a general reluctance to consider alternatives to n95s , which had been cheap and plentiful before the coronavirus struck . </s>  but

screening criteria . </s>  a donor ’ s blood must also have high levels of antibodies , proteins made by the immune system to attack the virus . </s>  similar efforts are underway at other hospitals , including mount sinai medical center in manhattan , montefiore medical center in the bronx , the mayo clinic and houston methodist hospital , according to dr. nigel paneth , a professor of medicine at

is to keep us alive until the vaccine comes around. ” in addition to being healthy and showing no signs of infection after testing positive for the virus , potential donors must satisfy all other requirements for giving blood . </s>  a donor ’ s blood type must be matched with a patient ’ s . </s>  and not everyone who contracted the virus will qualify , dr. donato said . </s>  for the

instead , they are epidemiologists and virologists who have become household names after spending most of their lives in virtual anonymity . </s>  while nurses and doctors treat patients on the front lines , epidemiologists and virologists who have spent careers in lecture halls and laboratories have become the most trusted sources of information in an era of deep uncertainty , diverging policy and raging disinformation . </s>  after a long period of popular backlash against experts and expertise , which underpinned a sweep of political change and set off culture wars in much of the developed world , societies besieged by coronavirus isolation and desperate for facts are turning to these experts for answers , making them national heroes . </s>  “ during a crisis , heroes come to the forefront because many of our basic human needs are threatened , including our need for certainty , meaning and purpose , self-esteem , and sense of belonging with others , ” said elaine kinsella , a psychology professor at the university of limerick in ireland who has researched the role of heroes in society . </s>  “ heroes help to fulfill , at least in part , some of these basic human needs , ” she added . </s>  the scientist-heroes emerging from the coronavirus crisis rarely have the obvious charisma of political leaders , but they show deep expertise and , sometimes , compassion . </s>  in italy , a nation ravaged by the virus more than any other in the world so far , dr. massimo galli , the director the infectious diseases department at luigi sacco university hospital in milan , swapped his lab coat for a suit and accepted he “ would be overexposed in the media ” in order to set things straight , he told one talk show . </s>  so the avuncular , bespectacled professor quickly became a familiar face on italian current-affairs tv shows , delivering no-nonsense updates about the unfamiliar foe . </s>  he called social distancing “ the mother of all battles. ” he fretted about

outbreak . </s>  by contrast , belgium , which has a similar population , just over 10 million , has recorded 1,283 deaths . </s>  professor tsiodras combines key features that make him appealing to the anxious public , says theo anagnostopoulos , the founder of scico , a science communications consultancy : he comes across as an ordinary person but with proven expertise , and is empathetic .

where the impact of the virus has been deeply felt despite a relatively low death rate . </s>  long respected for the depth of his knowledge and willingness to share it with peers , he never sought the limelight . </s>  colleagues have described him as an unlikely hero . </s>  for weeks , however , dr. drosten , chief virologist at the charité university research hospital in berlin , has become one of the most sought-after guests on television talk shows and the star of a daily podcast that started in february . </s>  in it , he delivers fact-based assessments of the risks germany faces based on the science behind sars viruses , which he has studied for years . </s>  chancellor angela merkel and her health minister , jens spahn , have also asked dr. drosten to consult on the political response to the crisis , although , as he was quick to point out to the german weekly die zeit , “ i ’ m not a politician , i ’ m a scientist. ” “ i ’ m happy to explain what i know , ” he said . </s>  “ scientific findings must be communicated to everyone transparently , so that we all can get an idea of the situation . </s>  but i ’ m also honest about what i don ’ t know. ” in some

painfully vulnerable , becoming sick themselves while carrying out their duties . </s>  in spain , the worst-hit countr y in europe after italy , dr. fernando simón has cut an endearing scientific hero figure . </s>  the director of spain ’ s health emergency center , he has delivered updates and insights into the crisis in a rasping voice , acting as a counselor for anxious citizens , who have peppered him with questions online , including whether people should take off their shoes before entering their homes ( they need not , he advised ) . </s>  dr. simón tested positive for the virus in late march , prompting a nationwide outpouring of sympathy and well wishes . </s>  in britain , neil ferguson , a top mathematician and epidemiologist who became known to the broader public seemingly overnight for modeling the spread of the outbreak , contracted the virus in march . </s>  his work spurred the british government to ramp up restrictive measures to contain the illness , having initially taken a more relaxed approach that promoted the idea of helping people develop immunity by exposing a large proportion of the population to the virus . </s>  unaccustomed to the outsize attention to their every word and action , some of the new national darlings have found themselves on the receiving end of brutal criticism . </s>  professor tsiodras was criticized by some in greece after footage emerged showing him standing at the pulpit of a seemingly empty church , even though the greek government had demanded that services be suspended because the greek orthodox church would not voluntarily comply with its isolation and social distancing measures . </s>  dr. drosten , in germany , was criticized when he originally challenged the wisdom of closing schools and day care centers — views he changed after a deluge of messages , including from colleagues who shared new data with him . </s>  slip-ups notwithstanding , professor kinsella says , these heroes provide “ clarity during confusing times ” — and that includes the moral kind . </s>  last month , just as mr. trump and other leaders openly debated the wisdom of lockdowns because of their devastating economic costs , professor tsiodras tackled the question directly . </s>  after giving the day ’ s update , he veered off script , looking nervously down at his clasped hands . </s>  “ an acquaintance wrote to me that we ’ re making too much of a fuss over a bunch of citizens who are elderly and incapacitated by chronic illness , ” he said . </s>  “ the miracle of medical science in 2020 is the extension of a high-quality life for these people who are our mothers and our fathers , and grandmothers and grandfathers. ” his voice then broke as he choked up . </s>  “ we can not exist , or have an identity , without them , ” he said . </s>  reporting was contributed by raphael minder from madrid , elisabetta povoledo from rome , melissa eddy from berlin and niki kitsantonis from athens . </s>    fos-sur-mer , france — the line of giant chimneys ceaselessly belching smoke in the air stretches to the horizon in one of the most polluted industrial zones in europe . </s>  for years , the inhabitants of fos-sur-mer , france , accepted their illnesses — for example , a cancer rate that is double the national average — in exchange for jobs in the nearly 200 factories , warehouses , gas terminals and industrial sheds that surround them . </s>  doctors ’ waiting rooms were often full . </s>  at the cemetery , tombstones recorded the deaths of young men cut down in their prime . </s>  in addition to the cancer rate , the asthma rate is also considerably higher than the national average , according to a publicly funded health study . </s>  but enough got to be enough . </s>  citizens in this otherwise sun-dappled corner of the mediterranean , just west of marseille , decided not long ago that they would take action , whatever their misgivings about losing their jobs . </s>  in a groundbreaking move , they took their fight to a place rarely used in france to resolve such disputes : the country ’ s justice system . </s>  many of the citizens of fos-sur-mer have banded together to file a criminal complaint accusing the steel , oil and petrochemical companies in the region of putting their lives at risk . </s>  it is a first in france : hundreds of citizens taking on an entire region ’ s industry in court , and threatening criminal sanctions . </s>  sylvie anane , who lives within breathing distance of the industrial plants , has suffered a debilitating tally of illnesses : heart problems requiring a stent in 2001 , ovarian cancer in 2002 , diabetes in 2003 , thyroid cancer in 2008 , a heart attack in 2010 , breast cancer in 2015 and another heart attack in 2018 . </s>  “ for a long time , nobody talked about the pollution , ” said ms. anane , one of the hundreds who brought the criminal complaint . </s>  “ it was a bit of a taboo . </s>  the idea was that it gave us work. ” the citizens have taken on not just the government , but also , in a first , an entire industrial basin : all of the marseille area ’ s heavy industry , which together pumps out one-fifth of france ’ s fine particles and a quarter of its heavy metals emissions . </s>  nearly 20 percent of france ’ s factories classified as high risk by the european union are clustered in fos-sur-mer , built alongside a giant inland lagoon . </s>  the citizens are calling into question a decades-old state industrial strategy that looked to pack as much heavy industry as possible into a confined area without questioning the human costs . </s>  now the state , typically seen in france as the ultimate protector , is being blamed for failing to shield residents from the pollution , and is accused of going easy on the companies for decades , and damaging the health of the whole region along the way . </s>  for example , in may 2010 , the prefect , the highest-ranking local representative of france ’ s central government , noted “ numerous uncontrolled atmospheric emissions ” at an arcelormittal steel plant in the area , according to the criminal complaint . </s>  “ the prefect evidently failed to issue any warnings , ” the criminal complaint says . </s>  arcelormittal did not respond to a request for comment . </s>  a health study conducted in 2017 helped trigger the legal fight when it revealed that it wasn ’ t just employees being put at risk . </s>  in terms of harm , the study “ showed no difference between the workers and the population as a whole , and that really surprised us , ” said barbara allen , an american sociologist who helped lead the study . </s>  the complaint of criminal endangerment was filed 16 months ago and now includes 260 residents , seven citizens groups and several unions . </s>  in france , an ordinary citizen can initiate a criminal complaint , which the prosecutor can then take up or reject . </s>  the prosecutors ’ office is expected to decide soon on whether to proceed with a full-blown investigation and who the defendants would be . </s>  julie andreu , the marseille environmental lawyer who filed the criminal complaint last fall , said her clients hoped the courts will force the industrial plants “ to conform to the norms and quit exceeding the pollution limits. ” a jail sentence for any of the defendants would be unlikely under the french system . </s>  four companies , including arcelormittal and a fuel refinery belonging to esso , part of exxon mobil , have also been targeted in a lawsuit working its way through the french justice system . </s>  whatever the outcome of ms. andreu ’ s suits , both criminal and civil , the novel legal battle underway in fos-sur-mer is likely to have far-reaching effects on citizen efforts to push back against polluters in france . </s>  “ this is a first , ” said christelle gramaglia , sociologist at the national research institute for agriculture , food and environment . </s>  “ in fos , the originality of it is , you ’ ve got the unions in the factories who are saying , ‘ the residents ’ problems are the same as ours. ’ ” exxon

would provide some additional information for any vaccine makers to assist them in doing the tests to validate rfc . </s>  revive and restore had been asking for some form of emergency authorization for use of rfc , given the stress of potential vaccine production . </s>  one company that is turning to the new test in a big way is eli lilly , which also pushed for broader approval of the new test . </s>  jay bolden , a biologist with eli lilly , said the company had been looking at rfc testing since 2015 for several reasons , including a consistent quality of a lab product , a supply that

a doctor ’ s office or urgent care clinic , talk to them about potential hidden charges . </s>  to be sure you won ’ t get a surprise bill , the best bet is to get your vaccine at a health department vaccination site or a local pharmacy once the shots become more widely available . </s>  can i choose which vaccine i get ? </s>  probably not . </s>  the answer depends on a number of factors ,

last longer than a year . </s>  we have to wait to see how durable the protection from the vaccines is . </s>  to determine this , researchers are going to be tracking vaccinated people to look for “ breakthrough cases ” — those people who get sick with covid-19 despite vaccination . </s>  that is a sign of weakening protection and will give researchers clues about how long the vaccine lasts . </s>  they will also be monitoring levels of antibodies and t cells in the blood of vaccinated people to determine whether and when a booster shot might be needed . </s>  it ’ s conceivable that

have the right to compel their workers to be vaccinated once a vaccine is formally approved . </s>  many hospital systems , for example , require annual flu shots . </s>  but employees can seek

girl 10 to 12 years old with large , thoughtful eyes. ” one thing she is not is a disney character . </s>  opening a real international disneyland in moscow would be out of the question amid the current political standoff with the united states . </s>  but russia ’ s decades-long quest to build a theme park , which began during the cold war rivalry with the united states , is finally reaching its fairy-tale ending . </s>  the $ 1.5 billion dream island , when it opens on saturday , may certainly remind some visitors of disneyland . </s>  in place of elsa from “ frozen , ” there will be the snow queen , and in the russian version of “ the jungle book , ” the jungle is populated by talking dinosaurs . </s>  developers say the park will be inhabited by dozens of fairy-tale characters , all domestically produced . </s>  dream island doesn ’ t mind if you invoke disneyland to describe the park , but will point out that it has no connections to the happiest place on earth . </s>  “ the word disneyland is on people ’ s tongues , ” said alena burova , a publicist for the site . </s>  “ in russia , we say disneyland when we mean just a theme park. ” the park has been built only now because it will benefit from something more essential than snow queens and fairy princesses : a large pool of middle-class consumers in the russian capital , something that was missing when two previous attempts failed . </s>  so , some 60 years after the soviet leader nikita khrushchev first floated the idea of building an analogue to disneyland , president vladimir v. putin stopped by to inspect the park on thursday . </s>  for amiran mutsoev , a former shopping mall developer who is the park ’ s owner and director , the site is a major bet that middle-class purchasing power will hold up despite western sanctions and low prices for oil , a major russian export . </s>  that the opening coincides with the coronavirus outbreak , when some people may want to avoid crowds , is another concern . </s>  “ will people come , or will they not come ? ” mr. mutsoev asked . </s>  “ of course , we are worried. ” the park expects five million moscow residents and two and a half million tourists , mostly from elsewhere in russia , to visit the animated dinosaurs and haunted houses each year , mr. mutsoev said . </s>  tickets on a weekend cost 11,000 rubles , or about $ 163 , for a

official poverty line . </s>  but moscow and its 13 million residents are an exception . </s>  the average wage in the capital last year was about twice the national average . </s>  the trickle of oil money has already given birth to new businesses , some of the world ’ s largest malls and what sociologists see as pent-up demand in the moscow middle class for better government services . </s>  well-to-do families , too , are a precondition for a theme park . </s>  khrushchev proposed building one in moscow called children ’ s wonderland after a 1959 visit to the united states when he sought to quickly replicate some american economic achievements , such as fast-food restaurants and widespread corn cultivation in the midwest . </s>  “ he wanted to do it , ” his granddaughter nina khrushcheva , a professor of international affairs at the new school in new york , said in a telephone interview . </s>  “ it was an idea to mimic the soft power that america has to make people ’ s lives more interesting and better. ” but the project got bogged down in debates over which themes to promote . </s>  the military wanted a martial element , with tanks . </s>  the soviets eventually proposed a park around cultural , educational and scientific themes . </s>  the attractions , a soviet magazine wrote , “ will be designed so children can learn of conquering space , about radio electronics and amazing successes in chemistry , physics and other fields of knowledge , ” while also somehow being fun . </s>  the government set aside land outside moscow , but never broke ground . </s>  in the early post-soviet period , president boris n. yeltsin sought to revive the idea by forming a nonprofit organization to develop the still vacant site . </s>  this group enlisted children to draw their own characters and fantasy lands as a basis for a park , but it lacked financing and instead leased the land to an outdoor market , a motorcycle club and a cement factory . </s>  the current iteration emerged as a partnership between the city of moscow , eager to appease its politically important residents , and mr. mutsoev , the developer . </s>  the city provided the land for free . </s>  vtb , a state bank , kicked in a $ 600 million development loan . </s>  nadya soloyeva , a moscow mother of two daughters ages 8 and 4 , said her job in public relations allowed her to afford the tickets , but she wondered whether the new fairy-tale characters would have the same emotional draw as disneyland ’ s . </s>  “ everybody is comparing these prices with disneyland , ” which now run $ 200 per person , she said . </s>  “ but will they sell emotions , like disneyland ? ” disney-like medieval towers rise at the entryway . </s>  but behind them lie gigantic , rectangular

remaining open through moscow ’ s long , grim winter . </s>  the theme park has nine zones . </s>  five were created by “ russian artists specifically for dream island , ” according to a promotional brochure . </s>  the others are licensed attractions : hotel transylvania , from sony pictures ; the smurfs , from the belgian company imps ; the teenage mutant ninja turtles , from viacom ; and hello kitty , from sanrio of japan . </s>  the cuningham group , a minneapolis firm that has designed a variety of theme parks , including warner bros. movie world in madrid , created all nine themed zones based on the russian and foreign-licensed concepts . </s>  one of the newly conceived zones drew from characters in a classic russian adaptation of “ pinocchio. ” the centerpiece zone is the snow queen ’ s castle , ruled by a fierce and beautiful monarch “ wielding power over snow and cold , ” not unlike disney ’ s princess in “ frozen. ” both characters are based on a hans christian andersen tale . </s>  mr. mutsoev said he had hired teams of artists and writers and was confident in the pull of his new characters . </s>  he has published new children ’ s books to flesh out the characters and tell their adventures . </s>  “ disney has its snow queen , and we have ours , ” he said . </s>  and he said he was glad he had ditched previous russian ideas of one-upping disneyland by infusing

received their ballots , there was only one recourse : putting their health at risk and defying a stay-at-home order to vote in person during the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  many chose not to show up . </s>  federal health officials have suggested that expanding voting by mail could help reduce crowds at polling places and therefore make elections safer amid the outbreak . </s>  the issues that have arisen in wisconsin offer a warning for other states of the potential pitfalls of a rapid , last-minute expansion of absentee balloting , particularly one marred by a flurry of court challenges and 11th-hour rulings that created confusion and chaos . </s>  the mix of missing and mismarked ballots suggests that thousands of wisconsin voters were effectively disenfranchised , an issue that justice ruth bader ginsburg warned of in her dissent to a supreme court decision on monday that blocked extended absentee balloting in the state . </s>  tens of thousands of people who did not receive their ballots in time , justice ginsburg wrote , “ will be left quite literally without a vote. ” but many republicans , and even some democrats , have continued to cast concerns on the security and

the easiest system to assure total integrity. ” in wisconsin , the missing votes could also portend a long legal battle over the results ; one race on tuesday ’ s ballot was a hotly contested state supreme court seat that , in a normal election , was expected to be extremely close . </s>  the margin in the state ’ s 2019 supreme court race was about 6,000 votes . </s>  “ this has all the makings of a florida 2000 if we have a close race , ” said gordon hintz , the democratic minority leader in the wisconsin state assembly . </s>  mr. hintz , who lives in oshkosh , was one of the voters who never received his absentee ballot — even though the state ’ s website said it had been mailed to him . </s>  he chose not to vote in person . </s>  others in mr. hintz ’ s district may have encountered the same problem . </s>  on tuesday , calls began flooding the office of dan feyen , the state senator whose district includes oshkosh , from voters saying they never received their ballots , even though they were told their ballots had been sent out . </s>  nearly every one of those voters had requested their ballots on one of three dates : march 18 , march 22 and march 23 , more than two weeks before the election . </s>  mr. feyen , a republican , filed a complaint with the wisconsin elections commission , asking it to investigate . </s>  he also wants those voters to be given a chance to fill out and return ballots . </s>  on wednesday , the commission received a phone call from a postal worker in milwaukee who said three bins of absentee ballots had been located that had never reached their destinations , mostly in oshkosh and nearby appleton . </s>  the number of ballots in the bins was not clear . </s>  a spokeswoman for the postal service , martha johnson , said thursday that officials were “ aware of potential issues with absentee ballots in wisconsin and are currently conducting an investigation into the claims. ” meagan wolfe , the elections commission ’ s administrator , said she did not think the u.s. supreme court decision left any room for ballots to be counted if they were not postmarked by tuesday ’ s deadline . </s>  “ there really isn ’ t any additional things for this election that a voter could do if their ballot didn ’ t make it by the deadline , ” she said in a news conference on wednesday . </s>  many of the complaints

options , ms. goodwin and her husband went to vote in person on tuesday . </s>  in racine , about 40 minutes south of milwaukee , dawn and jeff loken , also retired , complained that they did not receive their ballots . </s>  the two democrats finally trudged to the polls tuesday night , not to be deterred by what mr. loken , who describes himself as a “ die-hard democrat ” viewed as an intentional effort by republicans to suppress his vote . </s>  ( state republican lawmakers rebuffed the democratic governor ’ s request to postpone the election . ) </s>  some absentee voters who received their ballots and mailed them back in time are running into a separate issue : postmarking . </s>  after much legal wrangling over this year ’ s absentee ballot deadlines , the supreme court ’ s decision held that ballots must be postmarked by election day to count . </s>  but in at least one city , madison , a number of ballots received by the clerk were never even postmarked to begin with . </s>  “ we are still receiving mail now from the post office , and about half of it is postmarked , ” said maribeth witzel-behl , the city clerk . </s>  “ it ’ s probably by now a couple thousand that we ’ ve received from the post office with no postmark. ” she said her office is dating the ballots with its own stamp as soon as they arrive , and is working with the city attorney to determine what to do with them . </s>  even when postmarks are applied , they can prove problematic , particularly for some rural voters . </s>  michelle schwenneker , who lives in rural jackson county , said that the mail truck in her town comes once a day , at 7:30 a.m. , so if she put her ballot in the mailbox on election day it wouldn ’ t be postmarked in time . </s>  “ for me , basically , mailing your ballot and having it postmarked are basically two different things , ” said ms. schwenneker . </s>  with ballots still trickling in and results yet to be released , there has been no major legal challenge to tuesday ’ s election . </s>  but activist groups and election lawyers in wisconsin are still reviewing their options and monitoring reports of missing ballots . </s>  even in states that already vote entirely by mail , lost ballots can plague a system . </s>  in colorado , secretary of state jena griswold excoriated the postal service last november after 828 ballots arrived in denver-area mailboxes on the afternoon of a tight mayoral race in suburban aurora — too late for many people to vote . </s>  but perhaps nothing presented as great a challenge for wisconsin as the vast expansion of the absentee system in such a short period of time . </s>  more than 1.2 million ballots were requested this year ; only about 250,000 were issued in wisconsin ’ s 2016 spring election . </s>  kim wyman , the secretary of state in washington , a mail-voting state , said it is important for elections officials to work with local postal systems to make sure they can handle

threatened the health and economy of japan , prime minister shinzo abe has been almost invisible . </s>  public health officials , not mr. abe , became the face of government ineptitude when a troubled quarantine of a cruise ship led to hundreds of infections on board and the risk of further cases on shore . </s>  those officials have also been left to explain why the government ’ s testing for the virus has been stuck at around 900 patients a day , even as neighboring countries test up to 10,000 . </s>  in the past week , a backlash from an angry and confused public has finally forced mr. abe to take more of a front-line role , but his clumsy efforts have only succeeded in deepening the biggest political crisis of his more than seven years in office — the longest tenure of any japanese prime minister . </s>  mr. abe ’ s approval ratings have plummeted to the upper 30s in some polls . </s>  last weekend , after he held his first news conference on the crisis — a scripted affair with prearranged questions that left japanese journalists shouting at him for answers — twitter was flooded with over a million posts demanding his resignation . </s>  two days before , after weeks of inaction , he had blindsided parents by asking the nation ’ s schools to close for a month , sending many scrambling to find child care . </s>  all the while , cases of the virus have continued to climb , even as screening has remained constricted , leaving many fearful that a large number of infections are going undetected . </s>  japan recorded its biggest daily increase on wednesday — 33 — and confirmed a further 14 cases on thursday , bringing the total to more than 300 , not including the nearly 700 cases from the cruise ship diamond princess . </s>  twelve people in all have died . </s>  yoichi masuzoe , who once served mr. abe as health minister and headed japan ’ s fight against the 2009 swine flu pandemic , which killed dozens in the country , said the government ’ s handling of the outbreak had been “ so disastrous ” because mr. abe “ has stayed too long in power. ” mr. abe ’ s chokehold on authority has stifled dissent among officials ,

. </s>  for mr. abe , though , the very consolidation of power that seems to have hampered the official reaction to the virus may ultimately keep him firmly in place , no matter how much the public sours on him . </s>  japan ’ s political opposition has fallen into disarray and its news media has grown ever more deferential , leaving a widespread feeling in the country that there is no alternative to the sitting prime minister . </s>  “ there just isn ’ t anyone to direct the government in the way that he has , ” said brad glosserman , an expert on japanese politics at the center

finance law . </s>  through it all , the public hardly batted an eye . </s>  mr. abe has long enjoyed the benefit of the doubt among japanese voters , who in 2012 put him in office for a second time

for closing the country ’ s schools seem all the more shocking . </s>  japanese politicians and parents questioned its scientific basis and demanded to know how they were expected to both work and

mothers taking our temperature and saying : ‘ it ’ s 98.6 . </s>  you ’ re going to school , ’ ” says dr. julie parsonnet , an infectious-diseases specialist at stanford university . </s>  that number dates to 1851 , when a german physician named carl reinhold august wunderlich began taking what he purported were millions of temperature readings from 25,000 patients in leipzig . </s>  their average , he announced , was the celsius equivalent of 98.6 . </s>  that figure , which he defined as “ normal , ” has persisted , despite numerous more recent studies that put the average closer to 97.88 or lower . </s>  a 1992 study in jama suggested that the discrepancy could be explained by wunderlich ’ s primitive thermometer or other external variables . </s>  but parsonnet wondered if our average body temperature might have decreased . </s>  initially , she couldn ’ t find records going back far enough to find out . </s>  then in 2018 , the national archive of computerized data on aging received an update : medical records of veterans of the union army taken from 1862 until 1940 that contained 83,900 temperature readings . </s>  parsonnet and colleagues analyzed the data according to the veterans ’ birth decades and found that average body temperature steadily decreased by about .02 degree celsius per decade ; veterans born more recently were cooler . </s>  these data were compared with data collected between 1971 and ’ 75 and between 2007 and ’ 17 . </s>  over all , a similar pattern emerged : the average temperature of men born between 1800 and 1997 decreased by about .03 degree per birth decade . </s>  ( women born between 1890 and 1997 had a .029 per decade decrease but weren ’ t represented in the union army data . ) </s>  the most likely reason for such a change , parsonnet and co-authors argue in a study published in january in elife , a journal of biology and medicine , is that improvements in living standards , sanitation and medical care have reduced the number of cases of untreated chronic illness , including tuberculosis , syphilis and periodontitis . </s>  fighting infection increases a person ’ s basal metabolic rate — the amount of energy needed at rest per unit of time — and that raises his or her temperature . </s>  a lower average temperature therefore suggests a lower average metabolic rate . </s>  and a lower metabolic rate tends to correlate with a greater body mass , at least in animals . </s>  so far , researchers can only speculate about possible connections between a lower average temperature and rising obesity rates in people . </s>  ( many variables other than infection could have influenced the results : to take one example , a growing number of people live in homes with heating and cooling systems and thus expend less energy than previous generations did to maintain a constant body temperature . ) </s>  such a substantial change in average temperature over a fairly short period of history could have other , unforeseeable impacts . </s>  parsonnet points out that there are “ more microbial organisms in us than there are human cells , ” which creates a complex ecosystem . </s>  and like a human-size version of climate change , “ we ’ re seeing probably a change in our ecosystem that ’ s associated with this drop in temperature. ” yet we ’ re only beginning to understand all the ways temperature influences that ecosystem to help determine how we function . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates updated jan. 29 , 2021 , 2:27 p.m . </s>  et cardinal dolan , the leader of

temperature of vital organs fairly constant . </s>  ( it ’ s this core temperature that a thermometer approximates . ) </s>  temperature sensors in nerve endings , which produce the sensation of being hot or cold , prompt the hypothalamus to initiate adjustments like shivering to warm up or sweating to cool down . </s>  at any given time , your skin might be 10 degrees cooler or warmer than your core . </s>  and that difference — and thus how much energy the body has to expend to keep the core stable — seems to affect how the immune system functions . </s>  for instance , in 2013 elizabeth repasky of the roswell park comprehensive cancer center and co-authors reported in p.n.a.s . </s>  that raising the room temperature improved the ability of laboratory mice to fight off cancer after they got it . </s>  repasky and others are also experimenting with heating tumor cells to kill them or make them more susceptible to chemotherapy . </s>  already , certain abdominal cancers are treated with “ hot chemotherapy , ” in which the drug is heated to 103 degrees , which has been shown to increase how much of it is absorbed by cancer cells . </s>  separately , the heat from a fever

</s>  but bruno conti , a professor of molecular medicine at the scripps research institute , and colleagues have also found that mice genetically engineered to have a body temperature a half-degree lower than average lived longer than ordinary mice , even if they ate as much as they wanted . </s>  what other effects this has on an organism is unknown . </s>  “ for instance , ” he says , “ a brain at a lower temperature might not function as well. ” at the same time , other bodily systems might benefit from being cooler . </s>  h. craig heller , a biology professor at stanford , and colleagues have shown that muscle fatigue is caused by heat , which they believe triggers a temperature-sensitive enzyme that acts as a safety valve , stopping the production of chemicals that power muscle contractions in order to prevent the tissue from burning up . </s>  when heller cools muscle during physical activity using special gloves that chill blood as it moves through the hands , the muscle “ just keeps on going , ” he says . </s>  “ i ’ ve had freshmen doing more than 800 push-ups. ” it ’ s unclear if or how the coronavirus might change the use of body temperature as a diagnostic tool . </s>  in the near term , javaid says , knowing your own average temperature and how it fluctuates might help clinicians diagnose and treat some illnesses more accurately . </s>  he suggests taking it at set times for several weeks and giving that information to your doctor , if needed . </s>  “ i think what we ’ ll end up concluding is , just like people know their blood pressure , they also should know what is their temperature when they are normal , ” he says . </s>  but , parsonnet adds , as a rule , it ’ s also important to keep in mind that number ’ s limitations : “ if it ’ s normal and you feel sick , you ’ re still sick . ” </s>    a year ago a team of radio astronomers startled the world with the first photograph of a black hole , lurking like the eye of sauron in the heart of a distant galaxy . </s>  now it appears there was more hiding in that image than we had imagined . </s>  when you point a telescope at a black hole , it turns out you don ’ t just see the swirling sizzling doughnut of doom formed by matter falling in . </s>  you can also see the whole universe . </s>  light from an infinite array of distant stars and galaxies can wrap around the black hole like ribbons around a maypole , again and again before coming back to your eye , or your telescope . </s>  “ the image of a black hole actually contains a nested series of rings , ” said michael johnson of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics , not unlike the rings that form around your bathtub drain . </s>  dr. johnson was lead author of a study , describing the proposed method that would allow our telescopes to pry more secrets from the maw of any black hole , that was published in the march 18 edition of the journal science advances . </s>  he and other authors of the paper are also members of the team operating the event horizon telescope , a globe-girding network of radio telescopes that made that first image of a black hole . </s>  their telescope saw these rings , but it didn ’ t have enough resolution to distinguish them , so they were blurred into a single feature . </s>  the work , scientists with the project said , pointed toward new ways to shed

said , “ understanding the intricate details of this historic experimental observation has forced theorists like myself to think about black holes in a new way. ” black holes are potholes in eternity , so massive that they swallow even light . </s>  they were an unwelcome prediction of albert einstein ’ s theory of gravity , general relativity . </s>  it describes gravity as the warping of space-time by mass and energy . </s>  too much in one place would cause space-time to sag without limit . </s>  einstein thought that was crazy , but astronomers have found that space is littered with these apocalyptic creatures . </s>  there seems to be a supermassive black hole , weighing millions or billions of times more than the sun , lurking in the center of every galaxy . </s>  the event horizon telescope , named after the edge , the point of no return from a black hole , consisted of eight radio observatories on six mountains and four continents . </s>  all that observing power was yoked together by a technique called very-long baseline interferometry , to achieve the resolution of a telescope as big as the earth . </s>  for 10 days in april 2017 they pointed it at the center of the giant galaxy m87 in the virgo constellation , where there is a black hole as massive as six billion suns belching tongues of radio fire . </s>  the resultant image of gases heated to billions of

</s>  one is a russian mission called millimetron , which is optimistically hoping to launch in 2029 . </s>  another is the origins space telescope , which has been proposed to nasa for a launch in 2035 . </s>  dr. johnson said astronomers don ’ t know the mass of the m87 black hole they revealed last year to better than 10 percent accuracy , nor do they know if and how fast it is spinning . </s>  a space mission with a radio antenna would allow them to see the ring structure and determine the m87 ’ s mass to an accuracy of a fraction of a percent , and could estimate its spin . </s>  all this if einstein was right , he added . </s>  other theories of gravity and other types of compact objects ( wormholes , naked singularities , boson stars ) would suggest a very different ring structure . </s>  “ so this is a way of studying exactly what lies at the centers of galaxies , in a way that we can never learn from larger scale measurements such as the orbits of stars or gas , ”

to die of the coronavirus at disproportionate rates . </s>  fewer than a dozen states have published data on the race and ethnic patterns of the pandemic , but the picture is becoming clear . </s>  in milwaukee county , blacks represent only one-quarter of the population , but 45 percent of the coronavirus cases and 70 percent of deaths . </s>  in michigan , where 14 percent of the population is black , they make up a disproportionate percentage of cases ( 33 percent ) and deaths ( 41 percent ) . </s>  and in chicago , blacks make up half of all cases and 70 percent of the deaths even though the city is only one-third black . </s>  this data is central to understanding injustice and ensuring the optimal health of people , but it is gravely missing in this crisis — missing from health department websites , daily updates by political leaders and , until recently , news reports . </s>  we health professionals fear that covid-19 will further widen existing health gaps . </s>  that ’ s why my organization , the american medical association , is calling on laboratories , health institutions , state and local health departments and the department of health and human services to standardize , collect and publish race and ethnicity data so that we can begin to prioritize equity and effectively manage this pandemic . </s>  we need to know who receives tests , who tests positive , who is hospitalized , who dies and eventually who receives treatment and a vaccine . </s>  that also goes for clinical trials , which , historically , have largely excluded black and brown people . </s>  without this information , we limit our ability to fully understand this pandemic or create messaging that is effective at quelling misinformation and fears . </s>  it also means we can ’ t ensure equitable access to testing and treatment or fair distribution of resources . </s>  to be sure , the chaos around testing — unequal access to kits , unclear processing guidelines , backlogs of performed tests — will hinder us in fully understanding the impact of the virus . </s>  and while it ’ s appropriate that we prioritize the testing of those who are critically ill , we are missing the chance to test those who may have been exposed to the coronavirus . </s>  this is further fueled by the fact that those most marginalized , such as communities of color , may not have the same access to testing as others and may distrust health institutions , preventing them from seeking care . </s>  this is a recipe for undercounting , keeping structural harms and disease burden invisible . </s>  our call for the reporting of racial and ethnic data is not based on a poisonous argument that some races are more susceptible to the coronavirus . </s>  our call , instead , is based on widely known history that american health institutions were designed to discriminate against blacks , whether poor or not . </s>  my own organization , for example , made it harder for blacks to obtain a medical degree and practice medicine , with negative repercussions still evident to this day . </s>  natural disasters and epidemics compound the burden of disease experienced by certain communities . </s>  in the 1918 flu pandemic , jim crow policies meant blacks received inferior care , if they received any . </s>  the 1995 heat wave in chicago killed more than 700 people , disproportionately in black and low-income neighborhoods . </s>  and numerous empirical studies confirm gross differences in life expectancy by race and ethnicity , gaps that appear at the national and local levels . </s>  in chicago , for example , there is a nine-year gap between the life expectancies for black and white residents , with more than 3,000 excess deaths ( deaths that would not have occurred if the black mortality rate were equal to the white mortality rate ) among black people there every year . </s>  add covid-19 to the mix and there ’ s an even richer recipe for devastation . </s>  black communities have experienced the consequences of structural inequities in wealth , housing and education , to name a few areas . </s>  our scientific data , along with the stories from everyday people , is what sheds light on these realities . </s>  when the time comes to rebuild our health systems , we must commit to finding ways to structure and standardize the collection of all types of demographic data , of information not only about race and ethnicity , but also gender identity , sexual orientation and preferred language that have made people more vulnerable to the blows of public health emergencies . </s>  when institutions register patients , they must also have these categories on intake forms . </s>  not everyone collects this information , but it must become the normal way of doing business . </s>  in 1899 , w.e.b . </s>  du bois advised in his seminal study on the black community in philadelphia that “ we must study , we must investigate , we must attempt to solve ; and the utmost that the world can demand is , not lack of human interest and moral conviction , but rather the heart-quality of fairness and an earnest desire for the truth despite its possible unpleasantness. ” any effective plan to fight covid-19 must be shaped by an understanding of its spread and impact among communities of color and others marginalized in society . </s>  if we ignore

made his mark as a man of action , a hyperactive leader ever ready to face down the kremlin ’ s foes at home and abroad , and even wild tigers in remote russian forests . </s>  confronted with the coronavirus , however , a leader who was re-elected in 2018 with nearly 80 percent of the vote and who faces no serious threats to his power has been oddly passive . </s>  “ he is afraid — afraid for

putin understands that the best thing to do is stand to the side , ” mr. pavlovsky added . </s>  doing that became more difficult on thursday , however , when russia ’ s prime minister , mikhail v. mishustin , 54 — who was named just three months ago to give some new energy to the government — told mr. putin during a videoconference broadcast on national television that he had tested positive for the virus . </s>  mr. putin , 67 , responded by praising him as “ a very active person , ” and said “ what is happening to you could happen to anyone. ” to add to mr. putin ’ s troubles , the collapse of oil prices has removed a major stream of revenue for social programs , while russia ’ s oil- and gas-dependent economy is expected to shrink by 6 percent this year . </s>  but turmoil in the global oil market , unlike the health crisis , at least plays to mr. putin ’ s strong suits of geopolitics and high-stakes diplomacy . </s>  his joint efforts with president trump and crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia have done little to lift the market , but they have showcased mr. putin doing what he likes most : demonstrating russia ’ s indispensable voice in global affairs . </s>  by contrast , the pandemic has only highlighted what has always been mr. putin ’ s biggest vulnerability : a pronounced lack of interest or success in tackling intractable domestic problems like dilapidated hospitals , pockets of entrenched poverty and years of falling real incomes . </s>  adding to the gloom , an april 22 referendum on constitutional amendments had to be canceled because of

from the wreckage of his may 9 victory day extravaganza , mr. putin said that a military parade would still be held at some point and that , on the day itself , “ modern warplanes and helicopters will take to the russian skies to fly in formation in honor of our heroes. ” yet , having staked so much of his popularity on the revival of russia as a great power , mr. putin has fallen out of step with

prominent opposition leader , who has veered from denouncing the kremlin for building a corrupt police state to demanding a state of emergency , something only mr. putin can declare . </s>  such a move would strengthen already intrusive security services , but would also force the government to pay compensation to businesses hit by lockdowns and free them from having to pay rent to landlords and interest to banks . </s>  mr. putin has so far offered only piecemeal assistance . </s>  the last time russia had a full state of emergency was in 1993 under president boris n. yeltsin . </s>  mr. putin has so far shown no interest in reviving that traumatic precedent . </s>  it would not only cost the state a lot of money but would puncture one of his proudest boasts — that russia , thanks to his firm hand , has escaped the turmoil of the 1990s . </s>  cushioned by bulging financial reserves estimated at around $ 600 billion , russia has more room to maneuver than many countries . </s>  it also has reported relatively few coronavirus cases so far — a total of nearly 100,000 as of wednesday , compared with about a million in the united states , and a low death toll of 972 , compared with the american figure of more than 58,000 . </s>  but the epidemic started later in russia and is still worsening . </s>  and the economic damage has been severe , with workers outside a state sector

attempts at real protests , but these have all been quickly broken up by the riot police . </s>  the biggest of these was an anti-lockdown march on april 20 in vladikavkaz , a city on the edge of the caucasus mountains . </s>  for mark galeotti , a russia expert and author of a book about mr. putin , the biggest virus-induced threat to the kremlin is not popular unrest — “ people are not going to rise up in revolt , ” he said — but a “ decay of legitimacy. ” mr. putin , he said , had created a “ hyperpresidential system ” in which all important decisions were ultimately taken in the kremlin . </s>  but he “ has himself become less and less presidential , ” mr. galeotti noted , leaving others to announce restrictions on movement and other painful measures aimed at combating the virus . </s>  by placing more and more responsibility on local officials without surrendering any of his own powers , mr. galeotti added , mr. putin has “ violated a fundamental contract with governors and bureaucrats — the state ’ s middle management — who actually keep the system running. ” faced in 2014 with a similarly grave threat to russian interests created by the ouster of ukraine ’ s pro-kremlin president , mr. putin seized the moment by grabbing crimea . </s>  when , two years later , it looked as if russia ’ s closest ally in the middle east , president bashar al-assad of syria , might also fall , mr. putin jumped in to reverse the tide of syria ’ s civil war by sending russian warplanes and soldiers . </s>  the coronavirus , however , has often left him looking flat-footed

creating a deeply polarizing battle of narratives and setting back china ’ s ambition to fill the leadership vacuum left by the united states . </s>  china , never receptive to outside criticism and wary of damage to its domestic control and long economic reach , has responded aggressively , combining medical aid to other countries with harsh nationalist rhetoric , and mixing demands for gratitude with economic threats . </s>  the result has only added momentum to the blowback and the growing mistrust of china in europe and africa , undermining china ’ s desired image as a generous global actor . </s>  even before the virus , beijing displayed a fierce approach to public relations , an aggressive style called “ wolf warrior ” diplomacy , named after two ultrapatriotic chinese films featuring the evil plots and fiery demise of american-led foreign mercenaries . </s>  with clear encouragement from president xi jinping and the powerful propaganda department of the chinese communist party , a younger generation of chinese diplomats have been proving their loyalty with defiantly nationalist and sometimes threatening messages in the countries where they are based . </s>

fueled anger and destroyed economic growth , as well as abroad . </s>  in the past several weeks , at least seven chinese ambassadors — to france , kazakhstan , nigeria , kenya , uganda , ghana and

factual and legal basis ’ ’ and “ only invites ridicule. ” the suit seems to aim less at securing victory in court , which is unlikely , than at prodding congress to pass legislation to make it easier

theresa fallon , director of the centre for russia europe asia studies , referring to the anti-imperialist , anti-christian and ultranationalist uprising around 1899-1901 in china that ended in defeat , with huge reparations for eight nations over the next decades . </s>  “ the party ’ s cultivation of the humiliation narrative makes it politically impossible for xi to ever agree to pay any

health diplomacy , it could have been the opportunity for china to emphasize its compassionate side and rebuild trust and its reputation as a responsible global power , ” she said . </s>  “ but that diplomatic effort got hijacked by the propaganda department of the party , with a much more assertive effort to leverage their assistance to get praise for china as a country and a system and its performance in stopping the spread of the virus. ” in recent days , chinese state media has run numerous inflammatory statements , saying that australia , after announcing its desire for an inquiry into the virus , was “ gum stuck to the bottom of china ’ s shoe. ” beijing warned that australia risked long-term damage to its trading partnership with china , which takes a third of australia ’ s

france , which traditionally has good relations with beijing , has also been angered by critical statements by chinese diplomats , including a charge that the french had deliberately left their older residents to die in nursing homes . </s>  that prompted a rebuke from france ’ s foreign minister , jean-yves le drian , and anger from legislators , despite an early reciprocal exchange of medical aid like masks . </s>  recently , the german government complained that chinese diplomats were soliciting letters of support and gratitude for beijing ’ s aid and efforts against the virus from government officials and the heads of major german companies . </s>  the same has been true in poland , said the u.s. ambassador to warsaw , georgette mosbacher , in an interview , describing chinese

hong kong , a semiautonomous chinese city that enjoys special trade and financial relations with the united states . </s>  mr. trump said that he would ask his administration to revoke special

the zeal , the better , if it secures you a mask or ventilator . </s>  given the white house ’ s deathly delays and the president ’ s childish rants , america is yearning for a trustworthy parental figure — and a hammer . </s>  the warm , fuzzy feeling for the cold , calculating pol that developed among many democrats in the past week was summed up by bill maher , who told me : “ i see cuomo as the democratic nominee this year . </s>  if we could switch biden out for him , that ’ s the winner. ” he added , “ he ’ s unlikable , which i really like. ” progressives still have problems with cuomo ’ s stances on medicaid and the criminal justice system . </s>  and some people thought that he waited too long to totally button up new york , although the governor maintains that his systematic rolling closure was designed to prevent panic in the streets . </s>  but even jezebel blew him a kiss with a post by rebecca fishbein headlined , “ help , i think i ’ m in love with andrew cuomo ? ? ? </s>  , ” chronicling how , solo in her brooklyn apartment , she has become addicted to cuomo ’ s briefings and morphed from intense distaste for him to admiration for his “ measured bullying. ” then the governor actually called her to check in . </s>  on his own , after his 2005 divorce from kerry kennedy and his split last year from the tv chef and author sandra lee , he ’ d been thinking about the isolation of singles . </s>  “ you know , it was sad , the piece , ” he tells me . </s>  “ being alone in your apartment for virtually 24 hours a day for days and days in this fearful situation and there ’ s no one to lay on the couch with and watch tv with , and no one to hold . </s>  that ’ s terrible. ” to the surprise of many who did not associate the name “ andrew cuomo ” with the word “ empathy , ” the governor has become a sort of national shrink , talking us through our fear , our loss and our growing stir-craziness . </s>  “ this is going be a long day , and it ’ s going to be a hard day , and it ’ s going to be an ugly day , and it ’ s going to be a sad day , ” he told officers from the new york national guard on friday , charging them to fight this “ invisible ” and “ insidious ” beast and “ kick coronavirus ’ s ass. ” because new york is at the epicenter of the epidemic in the united states , with 519 deaths and 44,635 confirmed cases , as of noon friday , americans have their eyes on the state . </s>  cuomo knows this . </s>  “ new york is the canary in the coal mine , ” he said during one of his passionate televised pleas for the president to provide more ventilators . </s>  it is more than passing strange that in this horror-movie moment , with 13 people dying on tuesday at elmhurst hospital in queens and a refrigerated truck parked outside to collect the bodies , the nation ’ s two most prominent leaders are both queens scions . </s>  both men grew up in the shadows of their fathers , the hard-working sons of european immigrants . </s>  the trump family is a model of bad nepotism — noblesse oblige in reverse . </s>  such is their reputation as scammers that congressional democrats felt the need to put a provision in the coronavirus rescue bill to try to prevent trump-and-kushner inc. from carving out a treat of their own . </s>  cuomo-style nepotism at least has better values . </s>  donald trump got his start with his father discriminating against black tenants in their housing complexes ; andrew cuomo left his job as a political enforcer for his father , mario cuomo , also a three-term governor of new york , and created a national program to provide housing for the homeless . </s>  cuomo has brought two of his adult daughters onstage with him at briefings . </s>  he warned the 22-year-old michaela to forsake parties celebrating her graduation — in absentia — from brown . </s>  “ risk , reward , ” he lectured her in front of millions . </s>  and cuomo gave his 25-year-old daughter cara a dollar-a-year job on the virus task force , echoing the time his father gave him a dollar-a-year job as an adviser when he was about her age . </s>  his brother , chris , hosts a cnn show . </s>  the 62-year-old governor goes on it to bicker and banter with his 49-year-old baby brother about everything from the women swooning over andrew ’ s machismo style on twitter — “ you know that what people are saying about how you look really can ’ t be accurate , ” chris teased — to their relative prowess at basketball . </s>  in his briefings , andrew cuomo talks about how cabin fever is causing him to get annoyed with his dog , a northern inuit named captain . </s>  he talks about stopping his sisters from bringing their kids to see his 88-year-old mother , matilda , who is “ pure sugar ” but vulnerable to the virus . </s>  he says his mother was a little annoyed when he named a social distancing guideline for the most vulnerable “ matilda ’ s law ” in her honor . </s>  after dan patrick , the lieutenant governor of texas , suggested that older americans might be willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of their grandchildren ’ s economy and president trump buoyantly called for america to reopen as soon as easter , cuomo said flatly , “ my mother ’ s not expendable. ” he also tweeted : “ you can not put a value on human life . </s>  you do the right thing . </s>  that ’ s what pop taught us. ” at wednesday ’ s briefing , he displayed a picture of mario cuomo , who died in 2015 , amid all the graphs on infections . </s>  “ he ’ s not here anymore for you , ” he said , but “ he ’ s still here for me. ” he offered a quote from his dad about what government should be : “ the idea of family , mutuality , the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all , feeling one another ’ s pain , sharing one another ’ s blessings — reasonably , honestly , fairly , without respect to race or sex or geography or political affiliation. ” the quote was obviously meant to draw an odious comparison with the republican in the white house who seems immune to feeling others ’ pain . </s>  the two men go back . </s>  according to the trump biographer tim o ’ brien , fred trump was a regular customer at andrea cuomo ’ s grocery store in queens . </s>  andrew and donald knew each other as they rose in gotham . </s>  they were never friends , but donald trump donated to mario cuomo ’ s campaigns and made a tape for andrew ’ s bachelor party , warning him , “ whatever you do , andrew , don ’ t ever , ever fool around. ” both men have often had the twin designation of charming and ruthless . </s>  the president is pure id , and when the governor was his father ’ s consigliere , he was known as “ mario cuomo ’ s id. ” over the years , both have been called manipulative , expedient , bullying , vindictive , arrogant wheeler-dealers . </s>  they have both been described as obsessed with their press , thin-skinned and quick to belittle or intimidate critics . </s>  but , as lis smith , the democratic strategist who rumbled in new york politics before becoming mayor pete ’ s pygmalion , said , “ trump is selfishly ruthless for his own personal gain while cuomo is more benevolently ruthless. ” she continued : “ it also helps that cuomo knows intimately how to bend the different levers of government to his will . </s>  it ’ s where you see having been at hud , having been an attorney general of new york , having been a governor for 10 years — all that pays off . </s>  ruthlessness is good , if it ’ s for a good purpose . </s>  f.d.r . </s>  was ruthless. ” i wrote admiringly about cuomo ’ s l.b.j.-style blend of the velvet glove and the brass knuckles when he did what barack obama did not deign to do in 2009 and clawed back millions from the rapacious financiers scarfing up bonuses while they were taking federal bailout money ; when he pushed to legalize same-sex marriage in new york in 2011 ; and when he rammed through a gun control bill after the sandy hook children were slaughtered , surpassing obama ’ s efforts again . </s>  “ it took a terrible political toll on me , but it ’ s still the best gun law in the nation , ” cuomo says now . </s>  he learned how to be a mechanic when he was a teenage gas station attendant in queens and a tow-truck driver for the aaa with the call signal “ queens-15. ” and he still likes to get under the hood with a wrench and fix things , from the state budget to the engines of his light blue ’ 75 corvette and dark blue ’ 68 gto . </s>  it is jarring to watch officials like governor cuomo and dr. anthony fauci , the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , who have worked their way up through the system , gaining valuable wisdom , have to delicately deal with donald trump , the barbarian who crashed through the gates and who is ignorant about — and disdains — the bureaucracy he leads . </s>  trump is now using the ego arithmetic he once used to brag about the ratings he got on larry king ’ s show or the number of tv cameras he saw at rallies to falsely claim that his administration has done more tests than anyone and that everyone who wants a test can get one . </s>  he boasts about having the best tests on earth the same way he used to brag about having the best rolls in the city in the restaurant at trump tower . </s>  the governor got heated on tuesday about the elusive ventilators trump kept promising . </s>  but in this crisis , cuomo has put his own enormous ego aside to tend to the president ’ s , lacing his briefings with whatever praise for trump is justified , willing to do what it takes to get what new york needs . </s>  the subtext is on vivid display , though , when cuomo tweets : “ facts are empowering . </s>  even when the facts are discouraging , not knowing the facts is worse . </s>  i promise that i will continue to give new yorkers all the facts , not selective facts. ” the governor also makes a point of praising fauci , whose honesty has irritated a president who is intent on obscuring science with spin . </s>  cuomo said that through their constant calls , including in the middle of the night , they have become friends and that fauci is “ so personally kind. ” itching to get his crackling economy back , recklessly urging americans to gather for easter mass , the president sent a letter to the nation ’ s governors on thursday saying that his administration is working on changing its social distancing guidelines , classifying counties as high risk , medium risk and low risk . </s>  but this is asinine because we don ’ t have universal testing so we don ’ t know who is carrying the virus and because people travel with it . </s>  unlike trump the fabulist , cuomo the realist doesn ’ t shoot from the hip . </s>  trump , who is always alert to great performances by people who look perfectly cast , is well aware of the potency of cuomo ’ s briefings . </s>  he veers between acting like cuomo is ungrateful and should “ do more ” and acting like they are working together very well , depending on how thankful the governor seems for the president ’ s efforts . </s>  it was clear that trump did not appreciate cuomo pushing aggressively and publicly for the president to utilize the defense production act so that new york could get 30,000 ventilators . </s>  on thursday night trump told sean hannity that he had “ a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they ’ re going to be . </s>  i don ’ t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. ” but then he added , “ i ’ m getting along very well with governor cuomo. ” on friday , the governor hit back . </s>  “ well , look , i don ’ t have a crystal ball , ” he said . </s>  “ everybody ’ s entitled to their own opinion . </s>  but i don ’ t operate here on opinion . </s>  i operate on facts and on data and on numbers and on projections. ” he implicitly mocked trump ’ s tendency to rely on his feelings rather than data . </s>  “ i hope some natural weather change happens overnight and kills the virus globally , ” he said . </s>  “ that ’ s what i hope . </s>  but that ’ s my hope . </s>  that ’ s my emotion . </s>  that ’ s my thought. ” bizarrely , trump tweeted friday that the governor had simply misplaced the ventilators : “ thousand of federal government ( delivered ) ventilators found in new york storage . </s>  n.y. must distribute now ! ” to which cuomo responded that the president was wrong and “ grossly uninformed. ” the back-to-back daily press conferences of the governor and the president showcase some primal differences about how they see the role of government and the identity of the country . </s>  cuomo thinks what defines america is its humanity and its welcome mat for the globe . </s>  trump ’ s view seems to be the economy über alles , even if we have to leave some stragglers on the field . </s>  after risibly saying he never does anything rash , trump insisted : “ but the country wants to get back to work , our country was built to get back to work . </s>  we don ’ t have a country where they say , ‘ hey , let ’ s close it down for two years. ’ ” he seems to be following the george w. bush playbook from hurricane katrina : instead of going all in to save lives , he shrugs and says it ’ s the states ’ responsibility : we ’ re at war with nature ; the enemy is overwhelming us , but it ’ s really the local government that ’ s in charge , not the feds . </s>  “ we ’ re not a shipping clerk , ” trump said , when that ’ s exactly what the federal government should be when nurses are on tv all day begging for face masks . </s>  unlike trump , who tries to blame obama when he ’ s the one who diluted the pandemic response force , and literally says , “ i don ’ t take responsibility at all , ” cuomo regularly says “ blame me ” if anything goes wrong . </s>  when i covered gov . </s>  mario cuomo , he expressed his disdain for a political darwinism that was overshadowing the nation ’ s religious principles . </s>  once , in an interview in his office in 1991 , he got down a copy of teilhard de chardin from the bookcase and gave it to me , wanting to make sure i absorbed the lessons of the jesuit scientist and theologian who wrote : “ accept the burgeoning plant of humanity , and tend it , since without your sun , it will disperse itself wildly and die away. ” he worried that government had strayed too far away from franklin roosevelt , another governor of new york who felt a strong economy and compassion for the poor went hand in hand . </s>  he worried that america was spending “ more money for bombs , less for babies , ” as he said in the sonorous baritone that his son inherited . </s>  “ more help for the rich , more poor than ever. ” with president trump on a darwinian tear , i ask andrew cuomo how this crisis will change the way people look at government and how it will affect the 2020 election . </s>  he says that , in this era where personalities and celebrities rule politics , the pandemic “ changes the lens on government and you ’ re going to now inquire about experience and capacity and your past performance , almost like the normal hiring process . </s>  we got to a place in government where credentials didn ’ t matter and performance didn ’ t matter. ” this , he said , would never happen “ if you were interviewing a lawyer or a doctor or a nanny. ” i ask him if all this has revived his dreams of a presidential run . </s>  after a long pause , he answers : “ no . </s>  i know presidential politics . </s>  i was there in the white house with clinton . </s>  i was there with gore . </s>  no , i ’ m at peace with who i am and what i ’ m doing. ” his friends say that he will be loyal to joe biden . </s>  but if trump is re-elected , they speculate , cuomo could jump in in 2024 , following his 2022 fourth-term re-election in new york . </s>  or if biden is elected and steps down after one term , cuomo might get in . </s>  but that would mean he ’ d be up against whichever woman biden chooses as his veep . </s>  “ he ’ ll get criticized with the same b.s . </s>  about ‘ ambition ’ for going against ‘ the woman candidate , ’ much in the same way he did going against carl mccall in new york , but so what ? ” said one cuomo ally , referring to his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 2002 . </s>  “ it ’ s hardly a clean , wholesome game . </s>  and someday soon , don ’ t we really need to return to what leadership actually is , as opposed to symbolism ? ” cuomo has been through valleys — his divorce amid a cheating scandal ; his father ’ s political disappointments ; his own . </s>  he talks about character so much that he can sound like a televangelist at times . </s>  “ you can tell the strong from the weak , the selfish from the gracious , ” he tells me . </s>  “ i mean , these nurses who are willing to go take blood at these drive-through centers ? </s>  what courageous , beautiful people . </s>  i have other people who won ’ t show up for work . </s>  i have legislators who say , ‘ well , we ’ re not coming to the capital. ’ ” before the governor gets back to his horrific night shift and a dawn wake-up call , i ask him how this armageddon , which we know will last for months and months , will affect our identity . </s>  “ we ’ ll have a different country — better or worse , i don ’ t know , ” cuomo says . </s>  “ it will have a different personality . </s>  it will be more fearful . </s>  less trusting . </s>  but maybe there will be a greater need for intimacy. ” mario cuomo was known as hamlet on the hudson . </s>  he analyzed his worthiness so much , he left the field to the privileged , pampered preppies who never analyzed their worthiness — george h.w . </s>  bush and dan quayle . </s>  when mario was doing a socratic striptease about whether to challenge bill clinton for the presidency in 1991 , one woman got so impatient with his dithering , she mailed him a needlepoint pillow with the message “ carpe diem. ” now andrew cuomo is trying to wrest the lifesaving materials he needs from another privileged , pampered guy in the white house who never worries about his worthiness . </s>  but this cuomo doesn ’ t need a pillow . </s>  carpe diem is in his bones .

sleep patients ; i split my time between treating children with pulmonary and sleep issues , and lately everyone seems to be having sleep complaints . </s>  pediatricians in italy have seen widespread sleep disturbances , among other problems , in children during the pandemic . </s>  i wondered what sort of sleep problems our lockdowns were generating and wanted to try to help tired parents if i could . </s>  there aren ’ t many u.s. pediatric sleep doctors , and parents wait up to six months to see physicians in my clinic , so i took to social media and email to contact my network of parents and ask if their children ’ s sleep had suffered . </s>  i received more than 300 responses in one day and noticed several recurring themes . </s>  one common issue is that children are shifting their sleep schedule later , resulting in stressed parents and children . </s>  on the other hand , laura jean miller , a psychiatrist in atlanta , wrote that her teenage patients are sleeping later but feeling well rested . </s>  getting up late isn ’ t necessarily bad , especially for teenagers . </s>  however , when young children stay up late , they can push into the only downtime left to stressed parents . </s>  some research also suggests that later bedtimes are tied to lower long-term cognitive performance in young kids . </s>  a british team looked at 10,000 7-year-olds and found bedtimes consistently later than 9 p.m. in early childhood were associated with difficulty in reading and math in elementary school . </s>  if your child ’ s schedule is drifting later , keep the shift to one hour , or two for teenagers . </s>  longer sleep-related shifts will be harder to unwind when this is all over . </s>  stop screen time 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime , since intense , close-up light exposure in the evening will push sleep later by suppressing the secretion of melatonin , a sleep hormone . </s>  likewise , don ’ t close your child ’ s shades , since natural morning light may help wake her up . </s>  take a walk or play outside first thing to start the day with sunlight that will help her circadian rhythm . </s>  of course , if the schedule change is working for you , it ’ s ok to lean into it , temporarily . </s>  one mother told me her toddler ’ s sleep schedule moved two hours later , shifting from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. , so now she ’ s waking up at 9 a.m. instead of two hours earlier . </s>  now she and her partner let their daughter sleep in each morning so they can work . </s>  many parents said they are seeing more conflicts around bedtime or naps . </s>  although many working parents now spend all day with their children , that doesn ’ t mean they are getting as much quality time with them . </s>  as we bounce between conference calls , keep up with virtual schooling , prepare food and keep the house going , children can feel neglected and needier than ever at bedtime , so they push back . </s>  “ they almost seem more starved for my attention , ” wrote lauren assalley , a school psychologist from taylorville , ill. , with two young children . </s>  her husband works as a funeral director and has been out of the home for long days during the epidemic . </s>  a kid who refuses to nap poses a tough obstacle for parents trying to work remotely . </s>  if your child is demanding more attention at nap time and bedtime , try to carve out more quality time with him during the day , difficult as it may be . </s>  take breaks where you focus entirely on your child , even for 10 or 15 minutes , which may reduce your child ’ s neediness . </s>  [ now is a great time to help your child learn to play independently . ] </s>  also , make sure that your evenings are relaxed . </s>  some families have discovered leisurely evenings to be an unexpected benefit of social distancing . </s>  “ we ’ re actually finding bedtime to be so much more pleasant , and earlier , than when we ’ re both working all day , ” wrote lauren hansen , of westchester , n.y . </s>  if your child is older than 2 and refuses to nap , it ’ s ok to enforce 30 minutes of quiet downtime , even if you have to resort to giving them a screen . </s>  [ how to and when to get toddlers to nap ] many parents complained that their kids are waking up in the middle of the night and visiting a parent ’ s bed more than before . </s>  this can be a sign that your child is feeling anxious or is struggling to process stress . </s>  katherine benvenuti , a pastry chef in portland , ore. , opened a bakery and restaurant , named bar king , the week that oregon restaurants were closed down . </s>  her 3-year-old started waking up at night for two to three hours at a stretch . </s>  she and her husband stopped talking about coronavirus around him , which has made a big difference . </s>  “ he ’ s not waking up anymore and he ’ s falling asleep more easily , ” benvenuti wrote in an email . </s>  “ it ’ s hard to remember that , even when my children are quietly playing by themselves in the living room , they are absorbing all of what my husband and i are saying. ” watching the news can be stressful for some children . </s>  children also may be grieving missed birthday parties , school plays or athletic events . </s>  acknowledge these losses and try to find alternatives . </s>  if your child is sad about not being able to have a birthday party , arrange a surprise zoom call with family and friends . </s>  [ how to help your anxious child during the pandemic . ] </s>  physical activity , especially outdoors , seems to help

for any of this , and that ’ s ok . </s>  sometimes you just need to survive . </s>  one mother in buffalo , n.y. , whose husband is self-quarantining in the basement after a coronavirus exposure , told me she was breaking all the rules and letting her kids watch television before bed , sleep in her room and stay up late , which fixed their sleep problems . </s>  she knows she is developing

the risk of possible infection from the coronavirus . </s>  the risks to all aboard were reinforced on monday as japan ’ s health ministry said that an additional 65 people had tested positive for the virus , nearly doubling the total to 135 . </s>  according to princess cruises , which operates the ship , at least 20 of them are american . </s>  the ship already has the largest number of coronavirus cases outside the epicenter in china , where more than 40,000 have been infected . </s>  while the quarantine slapped on the diamond princess was meant to contain the virus , the conditions facing the crew could end up doing the opposite and help spread the illness , disease experts say . </s>  at least 10 crew members have been infected , with five cases announced on sunday and five more on monday . </s>  and according to employees , the infected crew members identified on sunday had been eating in the mess hall alongside their co-workers . </s>  it is not even clear how

specifics , the representative added that the company was “ implementing processes developed in coordination with public health officials to support the elevated requirements of this situation. ” some

prices are up to 20 times higher. ” this , even though face masks are not , on their own , a proven prophylactic against infection from the new coronavirus ( hand washing is more important , medical experts seem to agree ) . </s>  and yet we shouldn ’ t look upon this buying spree as a sign of irrational epidemic-panic . </s>  consider mask-wearing in its historical and cultural context , and you ’ ll see that in china , for example , it serves as far more than simply a means of protecting oneself from infection . </s>  masks are also a marker of medical modernity , as well as a signal of mutual assurance that allows a society to keep functioning during an epidemic . </s>  anti-epidemic masks as we know them today were invented in china more than a century ago , during the chinese state ’ s first effort to contain an epidemic by biomedical means . </s>  when the pneumonic plague struck the northeastern provinces of the chinese empire ( a region known then as manchuria ) in the autumn of 1910 , the chinese authorities broke with their longstanding opposition to western medicine : they appointed wu lien-teh ( also known as wu liande ) , a young and brilliant cambridge-educated chinese doctor from british malaya , to oversee efforts to stem the outbreak . </s>  the plague was about to meet its match . </s>  soon after arriving in the field , wu asserted that this plague wasn ’ t being spread by rats , as had been assumed , but was airborne . </s>  the statement was heresy , and turned out to be correct . </s>  wu proved his point by adapting existing surgeons ’ masks — which were made of a cotton wad encased in gauze — into easy-to-wear protective devices and ordered chinese doctors , nurses and sanitary staff to use them . </s>  he also made sure that the masks were worn by patients and their immediate contacts , and he distributed some among the general public . </s>  wu ’ s japanese and european colleagues on the ground were skeptical until the death of an eminent french doctor who wouldn ’ t cover up even while attending patients . </s>  gauze masks were soon adopted , extensively . </s>  some wearers would first stamp them with a seal from a temple — more than simply medical devices , the masks became talismans . </s>  the plague , which caused pneumonia , killed everyone it infected , sometimes within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms . </s>  by the time it abated in april 1911 , some 60,000 people had died , but wu ’ s masks were thought to have prevented an even greater disaster . </s>  the masks weren ’ t just an effective prevention device : they also were an excellent pr tool for proclaiming china ’ s position as a modern , scientific nation . </s>  and wu knew that . </s>  he made sure to have his anti-plague operations meticulously photographed , turning his mask into an emblem of china ’ s trailblazing ahead of western medicine . </s>  the photos were an international sensation : between january and march 1911 , newspapers across the world featured many shots of wu ’ s mask — which looks much like the white paper version we know today . </s>  cheap , easy to both manufacture and wear , and — for the most part — effective , it was a triumph . </s>  when the spanish influenza struck in 1918 , face masks were readily adopted . </s>  in the west , the use of masks did not last much past world war ii . </s>  but in china , masks remained markers of medical modernity and continued to be used for public-health crises . </s>  they were deployed during the korean war after mao zedong claimed that the united states had bombarded the newly communist country with biological weapons . </s>  since the late 20th century , in both post-mao china and post-british-colonial hong kong , masks have been used against air pollution . </s>  it was the 2002-3 sars epidemic that led to the massive adoption of face masks as personal anti-viral protection in china and elsewhere in east asia : more than 90 percent of hong kong residents reportedly wore them during the sars epidemic . </s>  once again , as in 1911 — but on a 21st-century scale — photographs of mask-clad crowds became iconic of sars across the globe . </s>  in the west , the image of asian people with masks is sometimes wielded , deliberately or not , as a signifier of otherness . </s>  but in east asia , the act of wearing a mask is a gesture that communicates solidarity during an epidemic — a time when a community is vulnerable to being divided by fear , between the healthy and the sick . </s>  various studies of the sars epidemic showed that mask-wearing created intimacy and trust in the face of danger . </s>  what the sociologist peter baehr noted for sars goes , too , for today : “ mask culture ” fosters a sense of a fate shared , mutual obligation and civic duty . </s>  it brings together people faced with a common threat and helps mitigate one of the secondary dangers posed by an epidemic : anomie , or the breakdown of social norms . </s>  face-mask-related humor , a fixture of sars , is back on social media in china today . </s>  mask-wearing is a social ritual . </s>  understanding epidemics not simply as biological events but also as social processes is key to their successful containment . </s>  members of a community wear masks not only to fend off disease . </s>  they wear masks also to show that they want to stick , and cope , together under the bane of contagion . </s>  christos lynteris is a medical anthropologist at the university of st. andrews , scotland . </s>

 and when andrew miller contacted them about a year ago and said he had an idea — maybe crazy , maybe great , maybe both — to get the band back together and become tulip farmers back in their old hometown , the chemistry still worked . </s>  mr. miller , who had been a yell leader with the cheer squad , then a trilingual mormon missionary before careers in the military and corporate crisis management , was just as persuasive , his friends said , as he had been back in the day . </s>  “ we went out to a happy hour and ended up buying a farm , ” said angela speer , who went from cheering to sociology to information technology before veering back into agriculture at tulip town , the 30-acre farm the partners bought last summer . </s>  the timing of their leap back together was stupendously awful . </s>  as the first crucial spring approached this year — tulip blooms flash and fade like fireworks in march and april — so did the global pandemic of the coronavirus . </s>  a delicate and gorgeous symbol of spring that for growers reaches a financial peak on mother ’ s day — one of the biggest flower-gifting days of the year , alongside st. valentine ’ s day — quickly became another victim of the pandemic . </s>  the annual tulip festival that draws hundreds of thousands of people north of seattle to skagit county , where three-quarters of the nation ’ s commercial tulip crop is grown , was canceled . </s>  and that put every other element of the tulip economy into free fall as well : no festival visitors paying to stroll through the blossoms and no money spent on restaurants , hotel stays , bouquets and bulbs for growing at home — a $ 65 million hit to the local economy that only compounded the economic blows of the state ’ s shelter-in-place orders . </s>  the blossoms were gorgeous , but few could see them . </s>  national retail chains that typically buy millions of bouquets canceled their orders as they retrenched to selling quarantine supplies and basics like toilet paper . </s>  “ you put down 10 months of preparation and plan for a spring payoff , the season when we generate near all our annual revenue , and this year basically disappeared , ” said brent roozen , a third-generation tulip farmer at roozengaarde , one of the nation ’ s biggest bulb growers , who raises tulips and daffodils on 800 acres spread across skagit county . </s>  the company , started by william roozen , an immigrant from the netherlands in the 1940s and brent roozen ’ s grandfather , is now trying to decide whether to retrench and plant fewer bulbs this summer and fall to save money , or go deeper into risk by betting on a better spring next year . </s>  “ if we want to hope for a future , we have to make some tough decisions now , ” brent roozen said . </s>  but the five newcomers on their much smaller farm — they named their partnership the spinach bus in honor of a rickety old vehicle that some of them rode as teenagers to and from their summer jobs in the fields — also realized something powerful . </s>  coming in new , however harrowing the collapse , meant that everything about how the tulip business was supposed to work was also new , to be tried and tested and improvised around to keep from sinking . </s>  “ ninety percent plus of our revenue comes in that four-week period , ” said randy howard , who studied accounting and taxation after high school ; he played _forward for the bulldogs and now serves as the partnership ’ s chief financial officer . </s>  “ so we had to pivot. ” the coronavirus outbreak › latest updates

knew who they were , ” said donnie keltz , who played guard on the mount vernon basketball team . </s>  mr. keltz — like all the spinach bus crew , in his mid 40s — had started his own insurance firm after college . </s>  “ anytime you get partners , you ’ ve got to have trust , ” he said . </s>  so , in adapting on the fly through march and april , the spinach bus partners took an ancient flower — evidence of cultivation goes back more than 1,000 years , and seed banks in the netherlands , the heart of the global industry , have specimens grown continuously since the late 1500s — and ignored much of what had been done before in selling it . </s>  “ part of the great thing about our group is that there are five of us , and we take turns having our moments of stress or anxiety or sadness because we all went through all of those feelings , ” ms. speer said . </s>  “ almost on a daily basis we were pivoting our business model. ” the first improvisation came a few days after stay-at-home orders were issued in washington state in mid-march . </s>  phone calls started coming in from people who were not going to be able to come in person to visit , said rachael ward sparwasser , whose journey went from cheer squad to lawyer and investor to tulip partner . </s>  “ would you be willing to ship blossoms ? ” the callers asked . </s>  the old business model had mostly involved shipping bulbs to gardeners , not fresh bouquets . </s>  the coronavirus outbreak › let us help you better understand the coronavirus are coronavirus case counts rising in your region ? </s>  our maps will

timeline of the events that led to these numbers may help you understand how we got here . </s>  their company had 600 shipping boxes in storage , and ms. sparwasser figured they might get orders to send 100 or 200 boxes , 20 stems each . </s>  “ within the first day , we sold through all of it , ” she said . </s>  within weeks , they boxed and sold 8,000 bouquets , a completely new business line started from scratch . </s>  then , as a wave of appreciation grew around the country for health care workers and others at the front lines of the virus , the idea struck that people might pay to have a bouquet of tulips sent as a donation and statement of support . </s>  so came their new color for courage business line — and more than 4,700 more orders at $ 15 a bouquet . </s>  in late april , the partners committed to planting a pick-your-own strawberry patch , which they figured could go well with the new beer and wine garden they started before the coronavirus shutdown . </s>  parents — once they are able to come back — can sip a skagit county brew while the children play in the dirt . </s>  then mr. miller had an idea : daily strolls up and down the rows of tulips at sunrise and

coronavirus may be fatal — to your retirement savings ! ” the note , punctuated with exclamation points , offered a seemingly magical solution , something called a fixed-index annuity . </s>  its “ value can only go up ! ” the note said . </s>  if that sounds too good to be true , that ’ s because it probably is . </s>  shellshocked investors will need to scrutinize sales pitches like this and not jump to make purchases in the middle of a major downturn , when they may be most vulnerable . </s>  not all annuitie s are ill-advised . </s>  some products can provide retirees with a pension-like stream of income , a valuable benefit that can bring peace of mind and a basic level of financial security . </s>  but fixed-index annuities are often pushed as a panacea to plunging markets , a safer alternative that allows investors to capture at least some of the gains , with none of the downside . </s>  the note , which mr. phelan received earlier this month , said : “ when the stock market goes up , its value goes up with the market . </s>  but if the stock market drops , it holds its value. ” in reality , that claim about fixed-index annuities is only partly accurate . </s>  they are essentially a form of insurance that tends to generate returns similar to certificates of deposit . </s>  but they have several attributes that are less appealing . </s>  most of your money is often locked up for many years , accessible only if you pay a painfully high surrender fee . </s>  and annuity brokers often collect commissions of 5 to 8 percent of the money invested , sometimes more , so they have a big incentive to close the sale . </s>  “ they are not designed or intended to be stock market competitors , even though everywhere you look they are sold that way , ” said scott dauenhauer , a financial planner and founder of meridian wealth management in murrieta , calif. “ a lot of them are being sold by people who are only licensed to sell fixed products . </s>  and if that is all you can sell , that is probably all you are likely to sell. ” and even before the novel coronavirus , they were selling briskly . </s>  fixed-index annuity sales rose to $ 74 billion in 2019 , a 6 percent increase from the previous year , according to cerulli associates , a research and consulting firm in boston . </s>  people often don ’ t understand the complex inner workings of these investments . </s>  “ if you need more than the back of a cocktail napkin to explain the math , i ’ d be concerned , ” said mark cortazzo , a financial planner and founder of annuity review , a service that analyzes annuity policies for a flat fee . </s>  on the surface , fixed-index annuities are attractive . </s>  you won ’ t lose your initial investment , and you will receive a guaranteed minimum rate of interest and have a chance of collecting slightly more if the stock market does well . </s>  but that ’ s where things get murky . </s>  business & economy latest updates

gamestop frenzy on wall street . </s>  what did local businesses that closed because of covid-19 mean to you ? </s>  the investment is typically tied to an index — often the s & p 500 , but , sometimes , a proprietary index you ’ ve probably never heard of . </s>  your annual return is often capped at , say , 2.5 to 4 percent . </s>  that cap can change from year to year , and the insurance company may use other levers to limit your upside . </s>  and the performance of the investment may trail the underlying index , because it often doesn ’ t include dividends . </s>  then , there are the less than obvious costs . </s>  the email pitch sent to mr. phelan proclaimed that fixed-index annuities “ often cost nothing at all ! ” that ’ s not true either , annuity experts said . </s>  the costs are baked into the overall returns . </s>  there are a rising number of fixed-index annuities available through registered investment advisers , which some experts said offer a better value . </s>  but if the adviser is charging 1 percent or more for their services , “ it might erase any benefit , ” mr. dauenhauer added . </s>  digesting all of the details is challenging . </s>  “ one of the things you don ’ t want to do is buy them when you are emotional , ” said david lau , founder and chief executive officer of dpl financial partners , which helps financial advisers find insurance products for their clients . </s>  “ now is not the time to rush out and buy an annuity because you are feeling panicked. ” other fairly complex annuities are being offered , too . </s>  one is called a buffer annuity , which allows investors to capture some gains , while curbing some , but not all , losses . </s>  then there are variable annuities , which may promise guaranteed income . </s>  they are essentially a portfolio of investments tied to an insurance policy , which can be expensive , yet they are frequently being offered to teachers and other public school employees . </s>  mr. lau suggested focusing not on what is being pitched , but on the problem you ’ re wanting to solve . </s>  maybe that ’ s a guaranteed stream of income , or ensuring you have enough to cover your fixed expenses . </s>  stan haithcock , an agent who calls himself “ stan the annuity man , ” said he ’ s been selling plain vanilla annuities that offer guaranteed income , but even these come in different varieties . </s>  one is a single-premium immediate annuity , which pays a guaranteed lifetime stream of income in exchange for a lump sum of cash . </s>  the other is a deferred income annuity , which starts the income stream at a future date , not immediately . </s>  “ people are starting to realize they need more lifetime income , ” said mr. haithcock of ponte vedra beach , fla. “ the problem is , agents aren ’ t selling the simplistic pro-customer annuities , they are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. ” as for mr. phelan , who teaches personal finance as well as math , he didn ’ t buy the investment he was offered . </s>  he said the timing made it seem a bit predatory , and he was happy to stick with his low-cost index funds . </s>    every sunday night for six years , louis kornfeld and rick andrews have walked onstage at the magnet theater in manhattan and created a refined hourlong play from scratch . </s>  these impromptu comedies stand out in a new york improv scene filled with quick-hit jokes and formulaic patterns , appearing more like scripted theater than almost any other improv show in the city . </s>  in an attempt to figure out how elite improvisers think so quickly , and on the same page , i debriefed with shorter , bearded kornfeld , 38 , and the taller , clean-shaven andrews , 33 , right after they left the stage , then again two days after their performance , with the assistance of video to try to break down the unspoken process they use to build a show together . </s>  ( though the theater has suspended operations because of the coronavirus , kornfeld & andrews and other shows normally staged there are being livestreamed on twitch tv . ) </s>  when kornfeld and andrews discuss their work , they can sound almost mystical , rarely talking about creating a show so much as discovering something that was already there . </s>  but what also becomes clear was that despite how effortless their shows seemingly come together , an extraordinary amount of action goes on inside their heads in every moment . </s>  the opening kornfeld : all we need to begin our show is the suggestion of a non-geographic location. ” audience member : “ bowling alley. ” at the start of any improv scene , every move has a huge impact , providing a foundation that both constrains and inspires what comes next . </s>  with that audience suggestion , andrews told me , he immediately imagined a rowdy st. louis alley he used to visit , tropicana lanes , a bustling place with a lot of noise . </s>  they each grab a pair of chairs . </s>  andrews sits down and strikes a pose of jaunty confidence , head swiveling to observe the chaos around him . </s>  as soon as andrews took this posture , he started thinking about it and drawing conclusions : “ it showed i was feeling good , but also trying to show that i ’ m feeling good , which is not the same thing , ” he said . </s>  the chairs were critical . </s>  by having two extras , they decided they were at the lane , not at the bar or walking to get popcorn . </s>  that opened up the possibility that someone new might be coming . </s>  andrews suspected someone was . </s>  kornfeld had no idea . </s>  in his peripheral vision , kornfeld saw the bouncy , assured energy of his partner , and he moved in the opposite direction . </s>  kornfeld ( trying to enter his name on a pretend computerized scoreboard ) : what do i shorten my name to ? </s>  andrews : pete ? </s>  kornfeld : nah . </s>  i want it to be — andrews : and they only give you three letters ? </s>  … kornfeld : it feels weird for it to be pet . </s>  and with that , an entire psychology and back story was born . </s>  “ once he named me pete and then pet would be my name , it instantly made me think it was insulting to think of someone as being like a pet , ” kornfeld recalled . </s>  “ i knew immediately i felt small and insecure and reassured around this guy . </s>  i knew i would be slowly revealing my insecurities so you can beef me up and make me feel better about myself. ” that sparked the question that would dominate the subtext of the first half of the show : what was making him so nervous ? </s>  andrews ’ s calm response to his friend ’ s insecurity clarified his character and the central relationship of the show . </s>  he didn ’ t tease or offer a big reaction . </s>  part of this , andrews said , is a strategy for opening scenes . </s>  “ if you keep the energy steady , ” he said , “ you hear the notes of the characters over and over again and then it just helps slowly coming to an agreement about what ’ s happening. ” but it was also a choice indicating this was a real friendship , and that he was playing someone trying to help . </s>  “ if i bristled , that would suggest a dynamic where i ’ m poking you and making you feel hurt , ” andrews said , adding that he believed that for characters to remain interesting for an hour , you have to empathize with them . </s>  kornfeld ( deciding to input his friend ’ s name , dou , short for doug , first ) : you happy with that ? </s>  andrews : yeah . </s>  i feel fine about it . </s>  kornfeld : back to position 2 . </s>  that didn ’ t buy me nearly enough time . </s>  i just feel like when the girls come here , i just don ’ t want to be pet . </s>  andrews had begun to think this might be romantic anxiety . </s>  but he wasn ’ t sure until he turned his head to look around , and kornfeld fretted about being called pet . </s>  now both performers were on the same page : it ’ s a show about a double date . </s>  andrews ( after some disagreement over whether “ adorable ” is the right adjective for pete ) : what ’ s your male machismo , what ’ s your attractiveness , what ’ s your main no . </s>  1 selling point ? </s>  kornfeld : oh , confidentiality . </s>  andrews cited a theory by keegan-michael key comparing improv comedy to a camera starting in a close-up and then slowly zooming out . </s>  but there comes a point where the picture frame gets set and that ’ s when pete said his main selling point was “ confidentiality. ” this odd response ( “ it sounds like confident so it ’ s almost like it ’ s as close as i can get , ” kornfeld said later ) got the show ’ s first big laugh . </s>  andrews made a mental note : this will be useful later . </s>  the biggest fear kornfeld : i haven ’ t had sex in a , in a little bit . </s>  andrews : ok. no judgment here . </s>  once the opening situation and relationship has been established , the next step is to answer the central question of the show . </s>  “ the audience needs one clear thing to explain why i feel so uncertain , ” kornfeld said , “ this guy ’ s deepest fear. ” he added that if you don ’ t push _forward and “ grab the trapeze , ” the show risks losing momentum . </s>  andrews : days , months , years ? </s>  kornfeld : a couple years . </s>  andrews : ok . </s>  cool . </s>  kornfeld : four , five years . </s>  andrews : more than a couple . </s>  kornfeld : maybe six . </s>  andrews knew this was a familiar comic trope plumbed in movies like “ the 40-year-old virgin , ” and that ’ s why he was skeptical of it . </s>  there are cheap laughs to be had with a big response . </s>  “ i am aware that people think this funny , but i don ’ t , ” he said . </s>  “ i actually feel at the heart of it , it ’ s just a person feeling vulnerable. ” noticing his partner ’ s posture and mood , he asked himself how a friend would respond and decided that the right move was to be generous and reassuring , to downplay the issue . </s>  so much anxiety is built around sex that the laughs will be there anywhere . </s>  kornfeld : a dry spell . </s>  andrews : a drought ! </s>  your libido is a desert now . </s>  it ’ s been deprived of water for quite a lot . </s>  kornfeld : yeah , it ’ s a moistureless libido . </s>  the days are hot and the nights are very , very cold . </s>  andrews : very cold . </s>  few plants and animals can survive . </s>  kornfeld : and the ones that can , real serious . </s>  andrews : they ’ re special . </s>  a couple snakes . </s>  some cacti . </s>  kornfeld knew that andrews was a fan of nature documentaries , and saw possibilities in his eyes . </s>  “ i could tell right there you were thinking about ‘ planet earth , ’ the documentary , ” kornfeld told him . </s>  this back and forth is what these artists somewhat derisively call “ a little bit of a move , ” but it ’ s not only that . </s>  in real life , they said , friends joke with each other . </s>  and they do so with as much playfulness and specificity as possible . </s>  “ i don ’ t subscribe to the jerry seinfeld school that some words are funny. ” andrews said , “ it ’ s about how you say it and the context . </s>  like when i say ‘ cactuses ’ and ‘ snakes , ’ they are picturing those actual things . </s>  but i could say that other things that were just as specific and probably would have gotten a similar kind of laugh. ” the endgame kornfeld ( after telling his date that pete and doug know each other from college when a third roommate had a breakdown that terrified them ) : fear creates a strong imprint , and you become very imprint-vulnerable with another person in a very terrifying experience . </s>  and so we imprinted on each other and have been best friends ever since . </s>  andrews ( about to bowl but cringing as he hears the story ) : pete ’ s really confidential . </s>  for 40 minutes , andrews had “ confidentiality ” on his mind . </s>  he ’ d been waiting for the right opportunity to reintroduce it and this callback was the start of the endgame of the show . </s>  “ in the first 10 minutes , you ’ re trying to get a sense of the layout , but we now know who these characters are and where the hot spots are , ” andrews said , explaining that there was more room for playfulness . </s>  andrews ( trying to play off a bowling misfire as if it was a strike ) : it bounced a little . </s>  hey ! </s>  there you go . </s>  in analyzing the implications of this move , andrews also made a deeper callback to his first move : the way his posture performed confidence and happiness , suggesting it was merely a cover . </s>  maybe he and his friend are both nervous . </s>  in trying to help his friend , he reacted too fast , making the situation more awkward , and revealing his own anxiety . </s>  not all of this was operating on conscious level , andrews said : “ i wonder if that ’ s lingering in my brain , that i ’ m also nervous and futzing around before a date. ” as the show moved toward the ending , what began as a small realistic scene about the anxiety before a date escalates into something more heightened and overtly comic . </s>  “ we want to get to that exaggerated point so gradually that you don ’ t even realize that it ’ s been so exaggerated , ” kornfeld said . </s>  “ by the end , this is no longer a real-life moment . </s>  it ’ s a ridiculous comedy moment . </s>  but we don ’ t want to start pounding that comedy moment so you expect more comedy moments . </s>  we want to get you there without seeing the work that got

that any law would undermine the territory ’ s liberties , including its tradition of free speech and an independent judiciary , allowing beijing to stamp out dissent . </s>  on friday , china ’ s ministry of public security , the national police and border control , promised in a statement on its website to apply “ all of our efforts to direct and support the hong kong police to stop violence and restore order. ” hong kong has its own police force , and the ministry does not currently have any legal enforcement authority in the territory . </s>  polling data on the new law is limited , but recent events suggest it will not be well received . </s>  officials have avoided pushing such legislation since 2003 because it was seen as deeply unpopular . </s>  pro-democracy candidates won 57 percent of the vote in district-level elections in november , trouncing their pro-beijing rivals . </s>  to counter that narrative , mr. xi , china ’ s most powerful leader in decades , is deploying the same political playbook in hong kong that he has used to consolidate his power in the mainland , using public displays of loyalty to project confidence at vulnerable moments . </s>  chinese officials use such shows of allegiance — known as biao tai , or expressing one ’ s position — to uphold mr. xi ’ s decisions to sideline political opponents and to tighten control of the media . </s>  “ they want this kind of well-orchestrated drama to present the picture that they have the people behind them , when clearly the majority of hong kong people are against the new law , ” said willy lam , a political analyst at the chinese university of hong kong . </s>  “ the message to the opposition is : ‘ we have already garnered the support of so many people , so it is futile to oppose it. ’ ” more than a dozen hong kong officials , including the leaders of the police , fire and immigration departments , have offered strikingly similar endorsements of a new law . </s>  they have denounced the antigovernment protesters as rioters . </s>  they have warned about the threat posed by terrorism and argued that stricter laws are necessary for long-term prosperity . </s>  the statements are a jarring display of conformity in a city known for impassioned debate , and they reflect beijing ’ s growing influence in the territory , experts say . </s>  “ the civil service used to be more politically neutral , ” said mr. lam , the analyst . </s>  “ hong kong is increasingly following the communist party ’ s customs. ” carrie lam , hong kong ’ s chief executive , has helped lead the charge . </s>  she has said the law has drawn a “ positive response ” from citizens and that foreign investors are eager for a safe environment . </s>  on thursday , she stood alongside residents of a pro-beijing neighborhood and signed a petition in support . </s>  critics warn that the security law could imperil hong kong ’ s status as a global financial center . </s>  so the party has mobilized allies in business to offer endorsements . </s>  mr. xi recently dispatched a top deputy to meet members of the city ’ s business elite who had traveled to beijing for the annual meeting of china ’ s legislature . </s>  the deputy , han zheng , who oversees hong kong policy , praised them for their diligence and reminded them of their duties as party members to publicly support the law . </s>  then came the talking points . </s>  growing unrest forced beijing to push through legislation , mr. han said , according to a video of the meeting released by the chinese government . </s>  social stability was important for hong kong ’ s economy , he said . </s>  afterward , as hong kong erupted in the first major public display of protest since the outbreak of the coronavirus , some of hong kong ’ s most prominent tycoons , including li ka-shing , hong kong ’ s richest man , issued public statements in support of the law . </s>  hong kong ’ s business community once served as a buffer to beijing ’ s hard-line policies . </s>  but the party has brought many business leaders to its side in recent years , turning to them for support during crucial moments of political instability . </s>  hong kong ’ s tycoons and business elite control about one third of the seats of the legislative council , the city ’ s lawmaking body . </s>  their support is rewarded by lucrative deals on the mainland . </s>  “ they fall into line when they need to because they hold the balance of power in the chief executive elections and in return their business is looked after on the mainland and here , ” said david webb , a longtime hong kong investor . </s>  beijing ’ s campaign has prompted even moderate members of the establishment to change their tone . </s>  michael tien , a pro-beijing lawmaker who had called for compromise during last year ’ s protests , said stricter laws were necessary . </s>  after attending legislative meetings over the last week in beijing , he said he had become convinced that china intended to use the law to go after a “ small majority of people in hong kong who are instigating conflict. ” “ the radicals are coming back , ” mr. tien said of the protests . </s>  “ it has gone beyond my tolerance and patience. ” the party has also activated its network of supporters in hong kong . </s>  a group affiliated with the pro-beijing establishment has set up booths with red , white and blue banners to gather signatures in support of the law . </s>  the group , known as the united front supporting national security legislation , has collected more than 1.8 million signatures , according to chinese state media . </s>  the group ’ s advisers include starry lee and regina ip , two pro-beijing politicians . </s>  during her time as hong kong ’ s top security official two decades ago , ms. ip tried and failed to pass a law against subversion and treason known as article 23 . </s>  ms. ip said the petition drives were organized by “ dyed-in-the-wool patriots. ” she said that while she was an adviser , she had not been taking part in the street activities because of “ scheduling conflicts. ” “ in principle of course we support it but i haven ’ t seen the details , ” ms. ip said of the security law . </s>  but , she added , “ it needs to be consistent with common-law principles so that our judges and police can enforce it. ” at lunchtime on thursday , several volunteers for the group held clipboards on a crowded walkway in hong kong ’ s bustling causeway bay neighborhood . </s>  while the group ’ s website required people to provide names , the last four digits of their government identification numbers and their phone numbers , passers-by in causeway bay were asked to sign without providing any other personal information . </s>  signatures ranged from full names and english first names to illegible scribbles . </s>  peggy lau , 40 , offered her signature . </s>  she said the protests have “ made the environment really bad and unsettling. ” “ marches that express people ’ s demands are fine , but not violence , ” said ms. lau , who works in finance . </s>  “ it affects our livelihoods so much. ” in mainland china , the state-run news media has provided heavy coverage of statements of support from hong kong officials , business leaders and workers . </s>  china central television , the state broadcaster , said the petition drive showed that “ all walks of life in hong kong fully support hong kong to defend the national security law. ” ms. mo , the lawmaker , said the campaign showed that the party viewed hong kong as a regular chinese city and that it would demand the same ideological conformity that it imposes in the mainland . </s>  “ when i was young i was taught you do not get harmony if everyone sings the same note , ” she said . </s>  “ that pluralism , that diversity , is supposed to be good . </s>  now there ’ s no such thing. ” javier c. hernández reported from taipei , taiwan , and alexandra stevenson from hong kong . </s>  elaine yu contributed reporting from hong kong . </s>  cao li and albee zhang contributed research . </s>    all it took was a pandemic of potentially unprecedented scale and severity and suddenly it ’ s like we ’ re turning into denmark over here . </s>  in the last few days , a parade of american companies that had long resisted providing humane and necessary benefits to their workers abruptly changed their minds , announcing plans to pay and protect even their lowest-rung employees harmed by the ravages of the coronavirus . </s>  uber and lyft — which are currently fighting state efforts to force them to pay benefits to drivers and other “ gig ” workers — announced that , actually , a form of paid sick leave wasn ’ t such a bad idea after all . </s>  drivers who contract the new virus or who are placed in quarantine will get paid for up to two weeks , uber said . </s>  lyft offered a similar promise of compensation . </s>  trader joe ’ s also says it will cover for time off for the virus . </s>  several tech giants said they would continue to pay their hourly employees who can not work during the outbreak , and amazon said it won ’ t dock warehouse workers for missing shifts . </s>  and after the journalist judd legum pointed out its long history of fighting sick-leave policies , darden restaurants , which runs several restaurant chains , including olive garden , said that its 170,000 hourly workers would now get paid sick leave . </s>  it wasn ’ t just sick leave . </s>  overnight , workplaces across the country were transformed into scandinavian edens of flexibility . </s>  can ’ t make it to the office because your kid has to unexpectedly stay home from school ? </s>  last week , it sucked to be you . </s>  this week : what are you even doing asking ? </s>  go home , be with your kid ! </s>  then politicians got into the act . </s>  the trump administration — last seen proposing to slash a pay raise for federal workers and endorsing a family leave policy that doesn ’ t actually pay for family leave — is now singing the praises of universal sick pay . </s>  “ when we tell people , ‘ if you ’ re sick , stay home , ’ the president has tasked the team with developing economic policies that will make it very , very clear that we ’ re going to stand by those hard-working americans , ” vice president mike pence said on monday , offering the sort of rhetoric that wouldn ’ t be out of place on the pages of jacobin . </s>  and wasn ’ t it almost funny how everyone and their doctor was suddenly extolling the benefits of government-funded health care for all ? </s>  when the trump administration told congress that it was considering reimbursing hospitals for treating uninsured americans who contracted covid-19 , republicans who had long opposed this sort of “ socialized medicine ” were now conceding that , well , of course , they didn ’ t mean it quite so absolutely . </s>  “ you can look at it as socialized medicine , ” representative ted yoho , a republican from florida , told huffpost . </s>  “ but in the face of an outbreak , a pandemic , what ’ s your options ? ” as i said , it ’ s almost funny : everyone ’ s a socialist in a pandemic . </s>  but the laugh catches in your throat , because the only joke here is the sick one american society plays on workers every day . </s>  the truth is that we ’ re nowhere near turning into denmark . </s>  many of the newly announced worker-protection policies , like sick leave and flexibility , are limited , applying only to the effects of this coronavirus ( the exception is darden ’ s new sick-leave plan , which the company says is permanent ) . </s>  the administration ’ s proposed relief plan could well be vaporware . </s>  and republicans ’ interest in universal health care is ephemeral . </s>  call it medicare for all but just for this one disease . </s>  but there ’ s an even deeper tragedy at play , beyond the meagerness of the new benefits . </s>  the true embarrassment is that it took a pandemic for leaders to realize that the health of the american work force is important to the strength of the nation . </s>  as the coronavirus spiders across the planet , i ’ ve been thinking about the illness as a very expensive stress test for the global order — an acute , out-of-nowhere shock that is putting pressure on societies at their weakest points . </s>  some nations , like iran and perhaps italy , are teetering under the threat ; others , like south korea , are showing remarkable resilience . </s>  the best ones will greet the crisis as an opportunity to build a more robust society , even better prepared for a future unseen danger . </s>  the worst will treat it as a temporary annoyance , refusing to consider deeper fixes even if they somehow stagger through this crisis . </s>  it is not yet clear how well the american system will respond , but the early signs are far from encouraging . </s>  what we ’ re learning is that our society might be far more brittle than we had once imagined . </s>  the virus has laid bare our greatest vulnerability : we ’ ve got the world ’ s biggest economy and the world ’ s strongest military , but it turns out we might have built the entire edifice upon layers and layers of unaccounted-for risk , because we forgot to assign a value to the true measure of a nation ’ s success — the well-being of its population . </s>  much of the danger we face now grows out of america ’ s tattered social safety net — the biting cost and outright lack of health care and child care and elder care , the corporate war on paid leave , and the plagues of homelessness and hunger . </s>  as the virus gains a foothold on our shores , many americans are only now waking up to the ways these flaws in the safety net cascade into one another . </s>  if companies don ’ t pay workers when they ’ re off sick , they ’ ll have an incentive to work while ill , endangering everyone . </s>  if you don ’ t cover people ’ s medical bills , they may not seek medical help , endangering everyone . </s>  there may be a silver lining here : what if the virus forces americans and their elected representatives to recognize the strength of a collectivist ethos ? </s>  the coronavirus , in fact , offers something like a preview of many of the threats we might face from the worst effects of climate change . </s>  because the virus is coldly indiscriminate and nearly inescapable , it leaves us all , rich and poor , in the same boat : the only way any of us is truly protected is if the least among us is protected . </s>  so what if we used this illness as an excuse to really , permanently protect the least among us ? </s>  i would like to imagine this bright future . </s>  but i ’ ll confess i ’ m not optimistic . </s>  more than a decade ago , america stumbled through the great recession without imposing many significant fixes for the excesses of our financial system . </s>  the titans of wall street were protected and working people were left with scraps . </s>  the coronavirus might teach us all to value a robust safety net — but there ’ s a good chance we ’ ll forget the lesson , because this is america , and forgetting working people is just what we do . </s>  office hours with farhad manjoo farhad wants to chat with readers on the

correlate to my own work as an artist , ” francie bishop good said of the collection in the upper west side apartment where she and her husband , david horvitz , live when they aren ’ t at their home base in fort lauderdale , fla. “ it ’ s very intuitive. ” for the foyer of their classic prewar apartment , she said , “ i wanted a powerful statement piece instead of a table that people put flowers on. ” and she found one , an alison saar sculpture of a nude woman , coated in black coal and rising more than eight feet tall atop a giant ball of yarn . </s>  they had to rig the sculpture to the top of the elevator cab to get it into the apartment , she said during a tour of the couple ’ s collection last month before social distancing was instituted . </s>  ms. good has traded with other artists since her years at the philadelphia college of art . </s>  she and her husband , who have two children each from their first marriages , began collecting art together in the early 1990s . </s>  ms. good was largely attracted to work by women and artists of color long before that kind of focus became popular . </s>  mr. horvitz , a real estate developer , followed her lead . </s>  throughout the apartment are bold , vibrant abstractions by artists including beatriz milhazes , madeline denaro and elisabeth condon . </s>  “ i see something different in this condon every day , little weird areas , ” ms. good said . </s>  she is also drawn to work with an “ outsider quality ” and a sense of humor , she said , pointing out paintings by scott daniel ellison and ceramics by sally saul and hilary harnischfeger . </s>  “ this artist ’ s taken unique materials that don ’ t go together — ceramic , crushed glass , paper , wood — and put them together , which has been very inspirational to me , ” said ms. good , whose own paintings , paired with her clay sculptures , will be exhibited online may 1 to 31 at the mindy solomon gallery in miami , and this summer at bookstein projects in new york . </s>  ms. good was recently named head of the board of the nsu art museum , part of nova southeastern university , in fort lauderdale . </s>  in 2017 , she and her husband made a promised gift to the museum of 100 works , by artists including teresita fernández and cindy sherman from their collection of more than 800 pieces . </s>  the exhibition “ transitions and transformations ” features works they have donated to the museum ( currently closed because of the coronavirus crisis ) by mickalene thomas , sue williams and cecily brown . </s>  the exhibition closes in january 2021 . </s>  “ each year we give them more , ” said ms. good . </s>  “ it ’ s my backyard. ” these are edited excerpts from the conversation . </s>  what led you to concentrate on art by women ? </s>  i didn ’ t realize we were collecting women . </s>  one day , i looked around and said , “ god , 90 percent of this stuff is women. ” then i started consciously focusing on women . </s>  women are more apt to — i don ’ t want to say air their dirty laundry , but show themselves and work on autobiographical themes more easily than men . </s>  like the louise bourgeois and alice neel . </s>  they ’ re portraits of other people , yet you can feel their angst . </s>  what was your first acquisition that wasn ’ t a trade ? </s>  a louise nevelson , one of the “ mirror shadow ” pieces . </s>  what i learned from that was : don ’ t spend your yearly budget on one piece . </s>  are you still actively acquiring ? </s>  i ’ m such a junkie . </s>  i ’ m trying not to collect that much anymore because i ’ m so old , but it ’ s hard . </s>  i just bought katie stout ’ s ceramic yellow piece of a woman . </s>  you touch her nipples and the light turns on . </s>  lots of times i ’ ll follow an artist

baby was due , aziza hasanova packed her bags and prepared for what she expected to be a relatively smooth delivery at a brooklyn outpost of one of new york city ’ s leading hospitals . </s>  but as the coronavirus pandemic swept across the city , all her planning was suddenly thrown into disarray . </s>  when she was 38 weeks pregnant , the hospital , n.y.u . </s>  langone in brooklyn , canceled her last checkup , and ms. hasanova said a clerk at the hospital discouraged her from coming in because of the risks of being exposed to the surging number of patients infected with coronavirus . </s>  ms. hasanova , who lives in midwood , brooklyn , grew anxious . </s>  “ i was really scared just to go to the hospital because for pregnant women it ’ s very risky getting the virus , ” ms. hasanova said . </s>  the solution she landed on seemed the only option so late in her pregnancy : giving birth at home . </s>  luckily , she found an available midwife . </s>  as the pandemic has battered hospitals across new york and other parts of the country , there has been a sharp increase in demand for midwives who can deliver babies at home or in facilities that are not part of the traditional health care system . </s>  “ people are reconsidering their birth plans and doing whatever they need to avoid hospitals , ’ ’ said sarita bennett , president of the midwives alliance of north america . </s>  jeanette breen , a midwife for over three decades who delivered ms. hasanova ’ s baby , described her business as “ a whirlwind of activity . </s>  we ’ re getting late transfers. ’ ’ “ they don ’ t want to be involved with covid and they would feel much safer at home , ’ ’ she added . </s>  ms. breen , who is based on long island , said she helped eight women deliver in the first three months of this year . </s>  but in april , she has had more than 25 inquiries , she said , nearly all of them women who had initially planned hospital deliveries with doctors . </s>  “ it ’ s not that they don ’ t want to be in hospitals ; it ’ s that they don ’ t want to be in a covid hospital , ” said a midwife in a recent zoom meeting of new york city midwives . </s>  on monday , the cuomo administration announced the creation of a panel to find ways to quickly authorize free standing birthing centers as alternatives to hospitals . </s>  “ birth centers can serve as a safe alternative

uninterrupted services to mothers scheduled to deliver at the hospital. ’ ’ “ it is unfortunate , as it seems , that in the case of this family , this was not the message they received , ” the hospital said . </s>  some hospitals have been so overwhelmed that gynecologists and obstetricians have been diverted to treat coronavirus patients , said dr. michael nimaroff , an obstetrician-gynecologist and senior vice president at northwell health , new york ’ s largest health care provider . </s>  women fear being infected in hospitals , though the greater risk appears to

to have a baby. ” in new york state , there are roughly 1,150 certified nurse-midwives , according to state figures . </s>  most work in hospitals ; a smaller number specialize in home births . </s>  only three-quarters of the states allow licenses for midwives to practice out-of-hospital deliveries . </s>  some states , like west virginia and georgia , do not offer licenses , making midwifery essentially illegal . </s>  other states , like new york , place restrictive rules on home births , including a requirement that midwives have a written practice agreement with a doctor or hospital .

may not be what was expected , but the care provided will be safe and of the utmost quality , ” he said . </s>  and in some cases women planning to deliver at home have ended up needing to go a hospital anyway because births were not progressing properly , a process that could be more fraught now given slower ambulance response times . </s>  but the risks have not dissuaded nervous expectant mothers from upending their original plans . </s>  trinisha williams , director of midwifery at the brooklyn birthing center , one of three free-standing birthing centers in new york , said the

most appropriate candidates . </s>  “ i ’ m having women call saying , ‘ i want a c-section here , ’ ” ms. williams said . </s>  “ but we don ’ t do that. ” another factor driving some women toward home births are new rules barring partners from being with mothers after they give birth , meaning women face recovery time alone . </s>  that is why jacqueline aiello , 33 , whose due date is in july , decided to switch from a hospital delivery at mount sinai south nassau to the brooklyn birthing center . </s>  she wanted to be close to her family . </s>  “ i ’ m hopeful of bringing a baby in a

outbreak is pushing the world ’ s airlines toward financial crisis — and that is starting to complicate efforts to tame airlines ’ greenhouse gas emissions , which had been growing rapidly in recent years . </s>  even though , in the short term , airlines have seen a sharp decline in air travel , and therefore emissions , demand is widely expected to bounce back eventually as the world resumes its embrace of flying . </s>  but in the meantime , the airline industry , an increasingly important contributor of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , is citing the financial pain caused by the heath scare as reason to weaken longer-term efforts to fight global warming . </s>  at least one major carrier , air france-klm , has cited the virus in calling for european countries to delay upcoming policies designed to curb air travel and reduce emissions . </s>  “ in view of the coronavirus outbreak , we are asking governments to suspend the introduction of new flight taxes , ” benjamin smith , the airline ’ s chief executive , said at the airlines4europe conference in brussels on tuesday . </s>  “ we definitely don ’ t need new taxes right now . </s>  it doesn ’ t make any sense whatsoever to burden airlines and passengers with higher prices , ” said jennifer janzen , a spokeswoman for airlines4europe , which represents 16 airline companies . </s>  “ environmental taxes are just going to make this bad situation even worse. ” for months , airlines in europe have been vocally opposing plans by governments to impose environmental taxes on air travel . </s>  at tuesday ’ s event , michael o ’ leary , the chief executive of ryanair , criticized a plan by austria ’ s government to increase environmental taxes on flights next year , calling them “ the equivalent of latter-day highwaymen , ” according to a video of a press event he and other airline executives attended . </s>  a ryanair spokeswoman , alejandra ruiz , said the airline ’ s environmental targets remained unchanged by the coronavirus outbreak . </s>  plummeting travel due to the virus could also throw a wrench in a longstanding united nations plan to cap emissions from international flights at 2020 levels . </s>  that plan would require airlines to offset increased emissions in future years by funding projects that reduce carbon dioxide by , for instance , planting trees or installing renewable energy . </s>  but the problem is this : if 2020 is an unusually low year for airline emissions — as it is very likely to be , because of the coronavirus scare — that could significantly increase the costs to airlines in future years if travel bounces back to traditional levels . </s>  a preliminary analysis by the environmental defense fund found that , at the high end , airlines might need to purchase up to 20 percent more credits than they were expecting to over the next three years , depending on how much air travel declines and rebounds . </s>  as the united nations civil aviation body prepares to meet this week to discuss the offset plan , some countries , particularly china , could try to push for significant changes to the program . </s>  environmental groups said that the outbreak shouldn ’ t be used as an excuse to weaken programs designed to address aviation emissions . </s>  “ this is a challenging time for airlines , but that ’ s no reason to weaken these rules and take airlines off-course on efforts to address climate change , ” said annie petsonk , international counsel for the environmental defense fund . </s>  airline revenue worldwide is now projected to fall at least 11 percent this year , according to the international air transport association , a trade group . </s>  the collapse in passenger traffic is expected to be particularly severe in countries hit hard by the outbreak , including china , italy and iran . </s>  over all , air travel accounts for between 2 percent and 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions . </s>  but the industry is experiencing rapid growth , with emissions expected to triple by 2050 owing to the rapid expansion of air travel worldwide , propelled by a proliferation of low-cost airlines and a booming tourism industry catering to a growing middle class . </s>  the expected long-term surge in emissions has led governments and environmentalists to focus on air travel as the next frontier for climate action . </s>  in europe , the swedish climate activist greta thunberg has helped popularize the idea that people should cut back on flying to shrink their carbon footprint , a concept often referred to as flight shame . </s>  last year , there were signs that air travel had dipped in sweden as environmental concerns around air travel grew . </s>  france plans to put an “ ecotax ” on nearly all flights starting in 2020 and the netherlands is preparing a similar policy . </s>  in november , nine countries asked the european commission in november to tax the carbon dioxide emissions from airplanes . </s>  and in february , a british court blocked the government ’ s plans to expand heathrow airport in london and add a third runway on the grounds that the plan did not take climate change into account . </s>  in response to the growing concerns about air travel ’ s climate effects , a number of airlines in europe and the united states have also recently pledged to clean up their act . </s>  delta air lines announced in february that it would invest $ 1 billion over the next decade on technologies to help the company become carbon neutral . </s>  british airways , air france and jetblue have announced they will purchase carbon offsets to blunt the effect of their domestic flights starting in 2020 . </s>  other companies , like united airlines and virgin , have started to invest in biofuels that would have lower emissions than jet fuel . </s>  but while airlines are not publicly saying that they are reconsidering those plans , observers warn that those investments could falter as airlines struggle for financial survival . </s>  the crisis will “ definitely affect airline climate actions , ” said adam klauber , a technical advisor at the rocky mountain institute . </s>  “ any sound business will prioritize their existing liabilities and payroll over voluntary investments in future sustainable aviation fuel volume. ” oil prices have also been falling sharply , which helps airlines because fuel is one of their biggest expenses . </s>  however , lower prices could also deter airlines from investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft , which could also be a setback to long-term efforts to rein in airline emissions . </s>  “ if fuel prices keep sliding and stay depressed , taking on newer , more efficient , cleaner jets will lose some appeal , and older jets will be kept longer , ” said richard aboulafia , vice president for analysis at the teal group , an aerospace consulting firm in fairfax , va. delta does not currently have plans to change its climate goals . </s>  an air france-klm spokeswoman , ulrike gendrot-haubold , said that the airline was “ monitoring closely the situation ” and it was too early to say whether its climate investments would be affected . </s>  if airlines do scale back their climate efforts , that could pose a problem for future efforts to restrain aviation emissions , since analysts expect that air travel is expected to rebound strongly if coronavirus fears eventually subside . </s>  “ this is the kind of blip that the industry has repeatedly experienced over the last two decades , ” said andrew murphy , aviation manager at the brussels-based campaign group transport & environment . </s>  “ whether it ’ s a financial crisis or terrorist attacks , reductions in air travel tend to be temporary and then bounce back. ” that said , it ’ s tough to predict the future , and mr. murphy also raised the possibility that as companies get used to teleconferencing during the current crisis , they might also reconsider their long-term reliance on air travel . </s>  “ in europe , we already saw people opting not to fly , it ’ s possible that this crisis could accelerate some of those trends going _forward. ” for more climate news sign up for the climate fwd : newsletter or follow @ nytclimate on twitter . </s>    london — david hockney ’ s 1966 pop art masterwork “ the splash ” sold on tuesday night , much as expected , for 23.1 million pounds , or about $ 29.8 million , with fees , at a sotheby ’ s auction of contemporary art overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak in china . </s>  the work , the star lot at the auction , is one of three painted versions of mr. hockney ’ s celebrated image of the spray thrown up by an unseen diver who has just plunged into the blue of a california swimming pool . </s>  the best-known of those images is the monumental 1967 canvas , “ a bigger splash , ” in the tate collection in london . </s>  this medium-size version , measuring 6 feet along each side , was being sold by the chinese real estate billionaire joseph lau , according to bloomberg news . </s>  ( sotheby ’ s declined to comment on the seller ’ s identity . ) </s>  the painting was acquired in 2006 for £2.9 million , or about $ 5.4 million at the time , at the same london salesroom . </s>  the hockney sold to a single telephone bid . </s>  it was the third-highest auction price yet achieved for one of the painter ’ s works , but it was still well behind the $ 90.3 million bid for “ portrait of an artist ( pool with two figures ) ” in 2018 . </s>  “ the hockney was a bit disappointing as a spectacle , but it has to be put in the context of what ’ s happening at the moment in asia , ” said brett gorvy , co-founder of lévy gorvy , an art dealership with galleries in london and new york . </s>  last week , the swiss-based mch group announced that this year ’ s edition of the art basel hong kong fair , scheduled to begin previews on march 17 , would be canceled . </s>  christie ’ s has also postponed its march sale of 20th-century and contemporary art in hong kong . </s>  and on wednesday , the chinese state-owned company poly auction said that it would be postponing its spring series of sales in hong kong , scheduled to begin april 3 . </s>  sotheby ’ s auctions programmed for that same week in hong kong were still going ahead , mitzi mina , head of the company ’ s london press office , said on wednesday . </s>  but international art buyers also have their eyes on the united states , where the frieze los angeles fair opens later this week . </s>  “ everyone is talking about the collections coming up for sale in may , ” mr. gorvy said , referring to the trophy-packed consignments of contemporary works from the estate of donald marron , valued at $ 450 million , and from the divorce of harry and linda macklowe , estimated at more than $ 600 million , that are likely to appear in new york salesrooms in the spring . </s>  “ people are keeping their powder dry , ” mr. gorvy added . </s>  with many of the world ’ s wealthiest collectors having other things on their minds , competition for the other “ blue chip ” works at the sotheby ’ s sale on tuesday was relatively subdued . </s>  an yves klein painting from 1960 , for instance , whose use of a female model as the “ brush ” has become problematic in the age of # metoo , sold to a single bid of £6.2 million . </s>  but , as mr. gorvy pointed out , there was lively bidding lower down the price scale , particularly for art rooted in the street . </s>  banksy ’ s repurposed “ vote to leave ” placard from the 2016 brexit referendum campaign , which had been a spoof exhibit at the royal academy ’ s 2018 summer exhibition , sold for £1.2 million , double its upper estimate . </s>  “ empirical mind state , ” a 2009 spray-painted canvas by the new york-based artist eddie martinez was contested by at least five bidders before selling for £615,000 . </s>  it had been valued at £100,000-£150,000 . </s>  the first major auction of contemporary art in london since britain left the european union ( other sales follow at christie ’ s on wednesday evening and at phillips on thursday ) raised £92.5 million , only a fraction below the £93.2 million of the equivalent event at sotheby ’ s last march . </s>  at the post-sale news conference , alex branczik , sotheby ’ s head of contemporary art in europe , said that the auction had been “ very much business as usual , ” with the number of asian clients registered to bid in line with other recent sales . </s>  eight out the night ’ s 43 sold works went to buyers from asia , he added . </s>  but dealers noted that at the auction itself , bidding was dominated by specialists based in europe and the united states . </s>  “ i wouldn ’ t imagine there were that many chinese bids . </s>  they ’ re normally the people backing this market to the hilt , ” said james butterwick , a london-based dealer , who bought the 1985 jean-michel basquiat painting , “ rubber , ” for an unnamed russian collector for £7.5 million , within the estimate . </s>  “ it ’ s a smart time for my client to buy . ” </s>    on tuesday , as the number of reported deaths from covid-19 in the united states topped 70,000 , the trump administration declared “ mission accomplished ” for phase 1 of its fight against the coronavirus . </s>  specifically , president trump and vice president mike pence announced that the coronavirus task force , which mr. pence oversees , had been so successful in getting the pandemic under control that the group would most likely disband within the month , to be replaced by a new panel focused on getting america back to work . </s>  “ we will have something in a different form , ” mr. trump explained during his tour of a mask manufacturing plant in phoenix , at which he did not wear a mask despite signs requesting that one be worn “ at all times. ” he said that america had moved on to “ the next stage of the battle ” and that “ now we are reopening our country. ” “ it really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we ’ ve made as a country , ” mr. pence told reporters at the white house . </s>  by wednesday morning , mr. trump had changed the contours , though not the essence , of his plan . </s>  in a tweet thread , he said the coronavirus task force would , in fact , “ continue on indefinitely ” but shift its efforts — and most likely some of its members — to “ focus on safety & opening up our country again. ” he closed with , “ the task force will also be very focused on vaccines & therapeutics . </s>  thank you ! ” whether dissolved or repurposed , the white house task force focused on coordinating the administration ’ s public-health response to the pandemic is soon to be no more . </s>  to which we can only say : no big loss . </s>  in theory , bringing together a collection of experts to oversee a coordinated federal response to a national emergency makes perfect sense . </s>  in practice , the first phase of mr. trump ’ s coronavirus task force was its own form of disaster . </s>  for starters , the president made clear early on that he wasn ’ t interested in marshaling a coordinated response . </s>  time and again , he ducked responsibility , pushing it off on the governors . </s>  on challenges ranging from acquiring critical medical supplies to coordinating and expanding testing ( which remains a problem ) to managing social-distancing restrictions , the task force has provided consistently uneven guidance and insufficient assistance . </s>  mr. trump often has undermined the recommendations it has made . </s>  whether pushing dangerous treatments of unproven efficacy or urging his supporters to protest the basic social distancing guidelines put _forward by the task force , the president has repeatedly scrambled the public-health message . </s>  complicating matters , multiple factions within the task force emerged with their own plans and priorities . </s>  these include a group of health officials overseen by the head of the white house domestic policy council ; a smaller group of medical doctors focused strictly on health matters ; and yet another shadow task force led by jared kushner , the president ’ s son-in-law . </s>  it ’ s little wonder the task force ’ s communication often has obscured more than it has clarified . </s>  the public manifestation of the task force has been a series of rambling briefings , at which assembled experts from in and outside government have wound up as little more than political props . </s>  the briefings often have descended into a blend of therapy sessions and campaign rallies , with the president spending hours each week airing his many grievances , praising himself , parading out business executives and public officials to laud his leadership and spreading misinformation about the virus and the administration ’ s handling of it . </s>  where is the website developed by google that the president , back in march , promised would soon enable people nationwide to check their symptoms and “ facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location ” ? </s>  the sprawling , easily accessible network of drive-through testing sites in the parking lots of retailers that mr. trump also promised in march is still struggling to ramp up . </s>  all too often , the president has overpromised and underdelivered — if he delivered at all . </s>  on april 28 , mr. trump boasted that the united states would “ very soon ” be able to conduct five million diagnostic tests a day . </s>  the next day , he had to walk back that claim — insisting , of course , that he had never made it . </s>  the briefings obviously have been a poor use of time for task force members , who help prepare the president ’ s talking points and then must stand around for hours during his performances . </s>  in addition to fielding questions from the media , they also need to respond to ( and diplomatically shoot down ) mr. trump ’ s more dangerous nonsense , such as when he mused about possibly injecting covid-19 patients with disinfectant . </s>  that surreal suggestion led the makers of clorox and lysol to plead with americans not to drink or inject their products . </s>  so reconfiguring the task force is unlikely to have many concrete negative effects . </s>  it seems mostly to be a p.r . </s>  move , a way for mr. trump to push his message — untethered from the consensus view of public health officials or public opinion — that the worst of the pandemic has passed . </s>  in its coming incarnation , the task force is expected to have a partially new cast of characters , with less emphasis on scientists and more on economic advisers . </s>  on tuesday , mr. pence noted that administration officials already have been discussing how to transition the response down to the agency level . </s>  if this means that the centers for disease control and prevention and other agencies will be empowered to take greater control , and suffer less meddling from mr. trump , all the better . </s>  the times is committed to publishing a diversity

coffins and stacked by the hundreds in morgues , it is clear that ecuador has been devastated by the coronavirus . </s>  but the epidemic is even worse than many people in the country realize . </s>  the death toll in ecuador during the outbreak was 15 times higher than the official number of covid-19 deaths reported by the government , according to an analysis of mortality data by the new york times . </s>  the numbers suggest that the south american country is suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the world . </s>  the figures provide a dire indication of the damage the virus can do to developing countries , where it can quickly overwhelm health care systems and even the government ’ s ability to keep count of how many people are falling to the disease . </s>  the pandemic ’ s hidden toll : half a million deaths far more people died in 2020 during the pandemic than have been officially reported , a review of mortality data in 35 countries shows . </s>  “ there were people dying at the doors of our clinics and we had no way of helping them , ” said marcelo castillo , head of an intensive care unit in a private hospital . </s>  “ mothers , husbands , asking in tears for a bed , because , ‘ you are a doctor , and you have to help us. ’ ” a staggering number of people — about 7,600 more this year — died in ecuador from march 1 to april 15 than the average in recent years , according to an analysis of official death registration data by the times . </s>  that spike stands in stark contrast to the number of deaths that the government has officially attributed to the coronavirus : 503 people by april 15 . </s>  mortality data in the middle of a pandemic is inexact , and it could change . </s>  the additional deaths include those from covid-19 , as well as from other causes , including people who could not be treated at hospitals inundated with coronavirus patients . </s>  but the data points to an enormous , and sudden , increase in deaths . </s>  three times the usual number of people died in ecuador during the first two weeks of april , when the number of people falling ill reached a peak — an extraordinary rise that exceeds increases seen in similar data from spain and the united kingdom . </s>  ecuador ’ s beleaguered government , which is also dealing with its worst economic crisis in decades , acknowledged early in the outbreak that its official mortality figures fell far short of reality . </s>  “ we know that both the number of infections and the number of deaths are falling short , ” ecuador ’ s president , lenín moreno , said in a public address on april 2 . </s>  “ the reality always overtakes the number of tests and the speed of attention ” of medical services , he said . </s>  there has been a surge of infections in the province that includes ecuador ’ s business capital , guayaquil , where residents are thought to have brought the virus home after visiting spain . </s>  in guayaquil , fatalities during the first two weeks of april were eight times higher than usual , the data indicates — a far greater rise than that of new york city , where fatalities were four times higher in recent weeks . </s>  within weeks of the first case being identified in guayaquil , hospitals were overflowing and burial systems collapsed under overwhelming demand , leaving dead bodies to pile in the streets and pushing families to bury loved ones in coffins made of cardboard . </s>  while the images shocked latin america and the world , the true scale of the crisis has largely been obscured by the government ’ s limited ability

instruction in the fall , but they face significant physical and logistical obstacles in protecting their students . </s>  residential colleges are sometimes described as “ landlocked cruise ships , ” because students live , eat , study and socialize together , often in close quarters . </s>  under ordinary circumstances , that is a good thing . </s>  but such tightly knit campus communities are tailor-made for spreading an easily transmissible illness like the coronavirus . </s>  the american college health association and others have laid out a basic process for reopening : test all students on arrival , then again after one to two weeks , and periodically throughout the semester ( though where colleges will get all these tests and the personnel to administer them remains a mystery ) . </s>  isolate students who test positive , trace all close contacts and quarantine those exposed for two weeks . </s>  maintain physical distancing protocols by reconfiguring residence halls , dining facilities , classrooms and other gathering places . </s>  require everyone to wear masks in public , insist on frequent hand-washing and good hygiene , disinfect high-touch spaces and surfaces regularly and restrict travel to and from campus . </s>  identify adequate quarantine space , probably by reserving blocks of hotel rooms . </s>  doing all this is much easier said than done . </s>  reconfiguring physical spaces and controlling access to promote physical distancing will be complicated and costly . </s>  achieving six feet of separation in classrooms , for example , may involve having half of the students attending in person on alternating days , while the other half joins remotely from residence halls . </s>  dining halls can have staggered shifts and expanded grab-and-go options . </s>  schools can put limits on the number of tables , the number of students at each table and the number of diners at one time . </s>  ideally , in residence halls , every student would have a single with a private bathroom , but for most colleges that would require bringing only a fraction of their students back to campus . </s>  a more practical but less protective alternative is to treat students in doubles or suites as a family unit , allowing them to live together without physical distancing , just as family members do when sharing a home . </s>  hallways can be marked for one-way traffic and occupancy limits established for common spaces . </s>  and all this doesn ’ t even begin to address sports . </s>  the real danger , however , is that these efforts to maximize safety could be negated if students themselves do what comes naturally : gather . </s>  a report prepared for connecticut ’ s governor notes with considerable understatement that “ the much-publicized behavior of students during spring break in florida suggests skepticism about full compliance with behavior norms. ” to keep students , faculty and staff safe on campus , colleges and universities will need to create and support a culture of respect for physical distancing — and students will need to be part of the effort . </s>  there are a few important things that schools can do to accomplish this . </s>  first , students should be asked to sign a social contract promising to adhere to distancing and other rules as a condition for returning to campus . </s>  just as many institutions rely on honor codes to limit academic misconduct , so too could they rely on social codes so students behave in ways that protect themselves and their classmates . </s>  second , students should be involved in the development of physical distancing protocols tailored to their campus and enlisted in educating one another about the importance of adhering to those protocols . </s>  schools could , for example , encourage student research papers , videos , artwork and oral presentations on topics such as how the virus spreads , what renders different age and ethnic groups vulnerable to the virus , and how some countries have managed to contain the virus , and make the best of them available to the campus community . </s>  third , college officials should work with student organizations to design and fund social gatherings ( preferably outdoors ) that are both fun and safe . </s>  fourth , institutions should consider an initiative that encourages students to design , produce and wear masks that reveal something about who they are and what they value . </s>  whether students will abide by the protocols needed to keep campuses safe remains an open question . </s>  but few , if any , want to return to zoom classes in their parents ’ basement . </s>  with some advice and encouragement , the vast majority of them , we hope , will embrace a culture of

standstill in the coronavirus pandemic . </s>  when it will come back , and in what form , is anybody ’ s guess . </s>  “ everyone will have to learn how to be comfortable around people , especially in large airports , on crowded planes , and in very large convention hotels and resorts , ” said henry harteveldt , founder of atmosphere research group , a travel analysis firm in san francisco . </s>  in a survey this month by the global business travel association , a trade group for corporate travel managers , nearly all its members said their employers had canceled or suspended all or most previously booked or planned international business travel , while 92 percent said all or most domestic business travel had been canceled or suspended . </s>  “ the current crisis , ” said john snyder , chief executive of bcd travel , one of the largest travel management companies , “ is like nothing we ’ ve ever seen before. ” the latest findings of str , a lodging research company , were equally stunning : in the week that ended april 11 , hotel occupancy in the united states was down 70 percent from the same week in 2019 , to 21 percent , and hotels ’ revenue per available room , the major barometer of profitability , was down 84 percent to $ 15.61 . </s>  these declines , said jan freitag , senior vice president of str , are the “ steepest ” ever measured by the firm , whose data goes back to 1987 . </s>  about a third of the association ’ s corporate travel managers said they expected business travel to resume in the next two months , while about one-fifth said in three months . </s>  another 16 percent didn ’ t even hazard a guess . </s>  a poll this month of 106 corporate travel managers who work for bcd clients found similar pessimism about any quick return , with a little over 40 percent saying they expected business travel to return to former levels this year . </s>  another 10 percent predicted that it would not fully return until at least 2022 , while 3 percent said it would never return . </s>  “ business travel won ’ t come back before we hear from public health officials that it ’ s safe to travel , ” mr. harteveldt said . </s>  “ once we hit the point where the virus is contained and , hopefully , treatment is available , i believe business travel will start to resume , assuming the economy hasn ’ t gone into a deep recession or , worse , a depression. ” and regardless of timing , experts anticipate both short- and long-term changes in business travel . </s>  airlines including american , delta and lufthansa are already blocking middle seats on flights , said michael derchin , an airline analyst , although that ’ s easy to do when planes are flying with a lot of empty seats . </s>  he predicted that after stay-at-home orders are lifted , airlines “ will do a lot of soul-searching about what the nature of travel will be going _forward. ” they may even re-evaluate how they seat passengers to provide more space , if social distancing becomes the “ new normal , ” he said . </s>  paul metselaar , chief executive of ovation travel group , a corporate travel agency in new york , said he anticipated that carriers would offer “ discounts like you ’ ve never seen before , since they will be desperate to get people back on planes. ” and expect efforts to promote cleanliness . </s>  in late march , delta announced that it was extending to all aircraft a cleaning process previously used on international planes : a nightly “ fogging ” program , which involves spraying high-grade disinfectant , effective against communicable

to convince the travelers that have not yet been infected that their hotels are safe spaces. ” he added that hotel operators would have to “ come up with new and novel ways to communicate to guests that the surfaces , door handles , phone receivers and toilet seats are clean and free from the virus. ” mr. freitag said in the article that his firm was predicting that revenue per available room this year would be down 50 percent from last year , “ with a sharp rebound ” of 63 percent in 2021 . </s>  “ these numbers are in flux , but the tenor of the prognostications is clear : this is

services company cowen , said she believed it could take two to five years for traffic to return to “ some level we could call normal. ” she expects corporate travel will bounce back before leisure travel , “ since leisure travelers don ’ t have the money to travel at any price. ” but , she added , corporate travel may never “ fully recover. ” mr. harteveldt said the recovery of the air travel system could be spotty , especially if travelers were fearful of visiting current virus hot spots like new york , or going through hub airports there . </s>  he predicted that airline service could initially be reinstated piecemeal , determined by health conditions in each state or country . </s>  and he anticipated that carriers would rebuild their systems “ at a lower level of operation ” that

said the longer “ we have the quarantine , ” the more people who hadn ’ t used such tools previously “ will get used to it. ” that , he said , could lead to a possible decline in the growth of international business travel — particularly to large hubs like london , paris , frankfurt , miami , los angeles and tokyo — and thus in demand for wide-body aircraft . </s>  mr. snyder said that

uncertainties that remain about covid-19 is how the human immune system responds to infection and what that means for the spread of the disease . </s>  immunity after any infection can range from lifelong and complete to nearly nonexistent . </s>  so far , however , only the first glimmers of data are available about immunity to sars-cov-2 , the coronavirus that causes covid-19 . </s>  what can scientists , and the decision makers who rely on science to inform policies , do in such a situation ? </s>  the best approach is to construct a conceptual model — a set of assumptions about how immunity might work — based on current knowledge of the immune system and information about related viruses , and then identify how each aspect of that model might be wrong , how one would know and what the implications would be . </s>  next , scientists should set out to work to improve this understanding with observation and experiment . </s>  the ideal scenario — once infected , a person is completely immune for life — is correct for a number of infections . </s>  the danish physician peter panum famously figured this out for measles when he visited the faroe islands ( between scotland and iceland ) during an outbreak in 1846 and found that residents over 65 who had been alive during a previous outbreak in 1781 were protected . </s>  this striking observation helped launch the fields of immunology and epidemiology — and ever since , as in many other disciplines , the scientific community has learned that often things are more complicated . </s>  one example of “ more complicated ” is immunity to coronaviruses , a large group of viruses that sometimes jump from animal hosts to humans : sars-cov-2 is the third major coronavirus epidemic to affect humans in recent times , after the sars outbreak of 2002-3 and the mers outbreak that started in 2012 . </s>  much of our understanding of coronavirus immunity comes not from sars or mers , which have infected comparatively small numbers of people , but from the coronaviruses that spread every year causing respiratory infections ranging from a common cold to pneumonia . </s>  in two separate studies , researchers infected human volunteers with a seasonal coronavirus and about a year later inoculated them with the same or a similar virus to observe whether they had acquired immunity . </s>  in the first study , researchers selected 18 volunteers who developed colds after they were inoculated — or “ challenged , ” as the term goes — with one strain of coronavirus in 1977 or 1978 . </s>  six of the subjects were re-challenged a year later with the same strain , and none was infected , presumably thanks to protection acquired with their immune response to the first infection . </s>  the other 12 volunteers were exposed to a slightly different strain of coronavirus a year later , and their protection to that was only partial . </s>  in another study published in 1990 , 15 volunteers were inoculated with a coronavirus ; 10 were infected . </s>  fourteen returned for another inoculation with the same strain a year later : they displayed less severe symptoms and their bodies produced less of the virus than after the initial challenge , especially those who had shown a strong immune response the first time around . </s>  no such human-challenge experiments have been conducted to study immunity to sars and mers . </s>  but measurements of antibodies in the blood of people who have survived those infections suggest that these defenses persist for some time : two years for sars , according to one study , and almost three years for mers , according to another one . </s>  however , the neutralizing ability of these antibodies — a measure of how well they inhibit virus replication — was already declining during the study periods . </s>  these studies form the basis for an educated guess at what might happen with covid-19 patients . </s>  after being infected with sars-cov-2 , most individuals will have an immune response , some better than others . </s>  that response , it may be assumed , will offer some protection over the medium term — at least a year — and then its effectiveness might decline . </s>  other evidence supports this model . </s>  a recent peer-reviewed study led by a team from erasmus university , in the netherlands , published data from 12 patients showing that they had developed antibodies after infection with sars-cov-2 . </s>  several of my colleagues and students and i have statistically analyzed thousands of seasonal coronavirus cases in the united states and used a mathematical model to infer that immunity over a year or so is likely for the two seasonal coronaviruses most closely related to sars-cov-2 — an indication perhaps of how immunity to sars-cov-2 itself might also behave . </s>  if it is true that infection creates immunity in most or all individuals and that the protection lasts a year or more , then the infection of increasing numbers of people in any given population will lead to the buildup of so-called herd immunity . </s>  as more and more people become immune to the virus , an infected individual has less and less chance of coming into contact with a person susceptible to infection . </s>  eventually , herd immunity becomes pervasive enough that an infected person on average infects less than one other person ; at that point , the number of cases starts to go down . </s>  if herd immunity is widespread enough , then even in the absence of measures designed to slow transmission , the virus will be contained — at least until immunity wanes or enough new people susceptible to infection are born . </s>  at the moment , cases of covid-19 have been undercounted because of limited testing — perhaps by a factor of 10 in some places , like italy as of late last month . </s>  if the undercounting is around this level in other countries as well , then a majority of the population in much ( if not all ) of the world still is susceptible to infection , and herd immunity is a minor phenomenon right now . </s>  the long-term control of the virus depends on getting a majority of people to become immune , through infection and recovery or through vaccination — how large a majority depends on yet other parameters of the infection that remain unknown . </s>  one concern has to do with the possibility of reinfection . </s>  south korea ’ s centers for disease control and prevention recently reported that 91 patients who had been infected with sars-cov-2 and then tested negative for the virus later tested positive again . </s>  if some of these cases were indeed reinfections , they would cast doubt on the strength of the immunity the patients had developed . </s>  an alternative possibility , which many scientists think is more likely , is that these patients had a false negative test in the middle of an ongoing infection , or that the infection had temporarily subsided and then re-emerged . </s>  south korea ’ s c.d.c . </s>  is now working to assess the merit of all these explanations . </s>  as with other diseases for which it can be difficult to distinguish a new infection from a new flare-up of an old infection — like tuberculosis — the issue might be resolved by comparing the viral genome sequence from the first and the second periods of infection . </s>  for now , it is reasonable to assume that only a minority of the world ’ s population is immune to sars-cov-2 , even in hard-hit areas . </s>  how could this tentative picture evolve as better data come in ? </s>  early hints suggest that it could change in either direction . </s>  it is possible that many more cases of covid-19 have occurred than have been reported , even after accounting for limited testing . </s>  one recent study ( not yet peer-reviewed ) suggests that rather than , say , 10 times the number of detected cases , the united states may really have more like 100 , or even 1,000 , times the official number . </s>  this estimate is an indirect inference from statistical correlations . </s>  in emergencies , such indirect assessments can be early evidence of an important finding — or statistical flukes . </s>  but if this one is correct , then herd immunity to sars-cov-2 could be building faster than the commonly reported figures suggest . </s>  then again , another recent study ( also not yet peer-reviewed ) suggests that not every case of infection may be contributing to herd immunity . </s>  of 175 chinese patients with mild symptoms of covid-19 , 70 percent developed strong antibody responses , but about 25 percent developed a low response and about 5 percent developed no detectable response at all . </s>  mild illness , in other words , might not always build up protection . </s>  similarly , it will be important to study the immune responses of people with asymptomatic cases of sars-cov-2 infection to determine whether symptoms , and their severity , predict whether a person becomes immune . </s>  the balance between these uncertainties will become clearer when more serologic surveys , or blood tests for antibodies , are conducted on large numbers of people . </s>  such studies are beginning and should show results soon . </s>  of course , much will depend on how sensitive and specific the various tests are : how well they spot sars-cov-2 antibodies when those are present and if they can avoid spurious signals from antibodies to related viruses . </s>  even more challenging will be understanding what an immune response means for an individual ’ s risk of getting reinfected and their contagiousness to others . </s>  based on the volunteer experiments with seasonal coronaviruses and the antibody-persistence studies for sars and mers , one might expect a strong immune response to sars-cov-2 to protect completely against reinfection and a weaker one to protect against severe infection and so still slow the virus ’ s spread . </s>  but designing valid epidemiologic studies to figure all of this out is not easy — many scientists , including several teams of which i ’ m a part — are working on the issue right now . </s>  one difficulty is that people with a prior infection might differ from people who haven ’ t yet been infected in many other ways that could alter their future risk of infection . </s>  parsing the role of prior exposure from other risk factors is an example of the classic problem epidemiologists call “ confounding ” — and it is made maddeningly harder today by the fast-changing conditions of the still-spreading sars-cov-2 pandemic . </s>  and yet getting a handle on this fast is extremely important : not only to estimate the extent of herd immunity , but also to figure out whether some people can re-enter society safely , without becoming infected again or serving as a vector , and spreading the virus to others . </s>  central to this effort will be figuring out how long protection lasts . </s>  with time , other aspects of immunity will become clearer as well . </s>  experimental and statistical evidence suggests that infection with one coronavirus can offer some degree of immunity against distinct but related coronaviruses . </s>  whether some people are at greater or lesser risk of infection with sars-cov-2 because of a prior history of exposure to coronaviruses is an open question . </s>  and then there is the question of immune enhancement : through a variety of mechanisms , immunity to a coronavirus can in some instances exacerbate an infection rather than prevent or mitigate it . </s>  this troublesome phenomenon is best known in another group of viruses , the flaviviruses , and may explain why administering a vaccine against dengue fever , a flavivirus infection , can sometimes make the disease worse . </s>  such mechanisms are still being studied for coronaviruses , but concern that they might be at play is one of the obstacles that have slowed the development of experimental vaccines against sars and mers . </s>  guarding against enhancement will also be one of the biggest challenges facing scientists trying to develop vaccines for covid-19 . </s>  the good news is that research on sars and mers has begun to clarify how enhancement works , suggesting ways around it , and an extraordinary range of efforts is underway to find a vaccine for covid-19 , using multiple approaches . </s>  more science on almost every aspect of this new virus is needed , but in this pandemic ,

sun-seekers packed into parks in wealthy , whiter areas of the city , lounging undisturbed as police officers hand out masks . </s>  so it is obvious that the city needs a different approach to enforcing public health measures during the pandemic . </s>  mayor bill de blasio seems to understand this , and he has promised to hire 2,300 people to serve as social distancing “ ambassadors. ” hopefully , the mayor will think bigger . </s>  one promising idea , promoted by city councilman brad lander and others , is to build quickly a kind of “ public health corps ” to enforce social-distancing measures . </s>  in this approach , specially trained civilians could fan out across the neighborhoods and parks , helping with pedestrian traffic control and politely encouraging new yorkers entering parks to protect one another by wearing masks and keeping their distance . </s>  police department school safety agents , who are not armed , could help . </s>  such a program could also provide much-needed employment for young people , especially with new york ’ s summer jobs program , which serves people 14 to 24 , threatened by budget cuts . </s>  another method to help social-distancing efforts may be the community-based groups that have been effective in reducing gun violence in some of the city ’ s toughest neighborhoods . </s>  the police department would play only a minimal role in this approach , stepping in to help with crowd control , for example , something it does extremely well . </s>  without a significant course correction , the department ’ s role in the pandemic may look more and more like stop-and-frisk , the policing tactic that led to the harassment of hundreds of thousands of innocent people , most of them black and hispanic , while rarely touching white new yorkers . </s>  mr. de blasio has scoffed at the comparison , though it ’ s not clear why . </s>  aggressive police enforcement of social-distancing measures is nearly certain to harm the health and dignity of the city ’ s black and hispanic residents . </s>  it could also diminish respect for the police department . </s>  which is why it makes sense that the city ’ s largest

planet , ” over the kind of minor-key guitar picking he also used in his megahit “ lucid dreams. ” ( he adds , “ we may die this evening. ” ) although it may be a studio illusion , the song sounds like it was largely finished ; juice wrld saw his self-destructive path . </s>  pareles jónsi , ‘ exhale ’ jónsi , whose androgynous voice was at the center of the sustained , endless-horizon

minutes , “ exhale ” lingers at a near-motionless tempo over open-ended piano chords , disrupted at times by taps , thuds and electronic stutters , intrusions from a more chaotic realm . </s>  near the end , a beat appears and the song starts to suggest some abstract gospel , with a message of absolution . </s>  “ this is the way it is/it isn ’ t your fault. ” pareles onyx collective featuring duendita , ‘ glad to be unhappy ’ the onyx collective is less concerned with doing something startlingly new than they are with mixing their nostalgias ; the result is a hybrid that feels as jumbled and personal as memory . </s>  onyx ’ s proclivities run from funk to free jazz ; their centering obsession is manhattan . </s>  even before the coronavirus threw the world into stark disarray , the collective ’ s music seemed to ask what would become of their beloved island — as a repository of myth and memory — now that everything feels digitized , capitalized , ephemeral . </s>  on “ manhattan

confiding like a classic jazz crooner . </s>  giovanni russonello ile featuring natalie lafourcade , ‘ en cantos ’ ile , from puerto rico , and natalia lafourcade , from mexico , trade verses about a

asks for “ alone time ” but quickly adds , “ don ’ t worry , i will be back. ” but as he offers extravagant promises for his return , his backup vocals sweep in like a tsunami ; their entrance is hair-raising before they enfold him in reassurance . </s>  pareles delanila , ‘ it ’ s been a while since i went outside ’ delanila — the songwriter and film composer danielle eva schwob — wrote “ it

coronavirus , stuck to a notably restrained set of measures on thursday , even as the trump administration exempted britain from a trans-atlantic travel ban . </s>  in a speech and a lengthy news conference that followed , mr. johnson and his health and science advisers said the government is asking people with flu-like symptoms to stay at home for seven days and calling on elderly people to avoid cruises and schools to cancel field trips abroad . </s>  but britain will not close its schools and it has yet to ban large public gatherings , like concerts or sports events . </s>  mr. johnson ’ s approach was in marked contrast to those imposed by neighbors like ireland and denmark , where the authorities said they would ban mass gatherings and close schools . </s>  it raised further questions about why president trump exempted britain from the travel ban , but not france or germany , both of which have gone further than britain to try to limit the spread of the disease . </s>  medical officials estimated the number of infected people in the country at between 5,000 and 10,000 , some 10 to 20 times the official estimate of 590 cases . </s>  these numbers , they warned , will rise rapidly over the coming weeks . </s>  on thursday , the virus took another high-profile casualty : the negotiations between britain and the european union for a post-brexit trade agreement . </s>  already under heavy pressure from a compressed calendar , the two sides said they would not meet in person next week in london as scheduled but would explore other options , like conducting the session via video conference . </s>  “ it ’ s now a global pandemic , and the number of cases will rise sharply , ” mr. johnson said at a downing street news conference . </s>  “ many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. ” britain ’ s reluctance to follow its neighbors reveals both a scientific skepticism of the efficacy of actions like school closings and travel bans , as well as a calculated decision , which government officials said was based on sophisticated modeling , to spread out the effects of the virus , so fewer people are sick at any one time and the national health service , which is less busy in the summer months , is not overwhelmed . </s>  britain , in effect , is accepting that people will become infected as the price for building up immunity in the population . </s>  also , if they enact radical measures too soon , the officials said , the risk is that it will make people resistant to such policies later on , when the virus is more widespread and those measures would have a greater impact . </s>  schools , for example , would have to be closed for between 13 and 16 weeks to be effective , they said . </s>  mr. johnson said he understood that the public might question the disparity between britain and other countries , but he said the strategy was based on the recommendations of his advisers — a potentially risky course

announcing the travel ban , mr. trump said he was targeting the european union because , he claimed , it “ failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from china and other hot spots. ” but british officials said such bans do not work , noting that three quarters of the patients in intensive care in britain had no history of traveling . </s>  britain ’ s main policy shift was to ask those who have a temperature of more than 37.8 degrees celsius , or 100.4 fahrenheit , or a persistent cough that lasts more than a few hours , to stay home for seven days . </s>  scientists said the disease is most infectious around the time when people first suffer symptoms , making this form of self-isolation the most effective step in slowing its spread . </s>  mr. johnson announced his steps only hours after scotland ’ s first minister , nicola sturgeon , said events with 500 people or more should be called off , while the irish prime minister , leo varadkar , said that schools , colleges and child-care facilities would be closed until march 29 . </s>  the johnson government argued that canceling major public events would have limited impact — only a 5 percent reduction in the spread , it estimated . </s>  if people watch sports events in bars , rather than in open air stadiums , they could be more at risk , the officials said . </s>  as for school closings , they said it would lead to children spending more time with grandparents , risking the spread of the virus to a more vulnerable age group . </s>  moreover , parents in critical jobs , including in the health service , would

the evolution of the virus . </s>  the number of cases jumped by 140 on thursday , the first time that the daily increase exceeded 100 . </s>  mr. trump ’ s exemption appeared mostly a symbolic pat on the back for britain ’ s departure from the european union , a policy he has championed . </s>  in its proclamation enforcing the ban , the white house said it had targeted the 26 countries in the schengen zone because “ the free flow of people between the schengen area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult. ” but travel between schengen countries and britain is scarcely more restricted ; trains run hourly between london and the continent . </s>  the state department said secretary of state mike pompeo spoke with britain ’ s foreign secretary , dominic raab , on wednesday about the rocket attack on american and british troops in iraq . </s>  but the department ’ s statement made no mention that mr. pompeo told mr. raab of the impending travel ban . </s>  diplomats said they were not surprised by the white house ’ s lack of warning , given that it had failed to consult or tip off allies before previous sensitive decisions . </s>  some said the exemption would be a relief to members of mr. johnson ’ s government , given the economic disruption that would be caused by a ban . </s>  for brexiteers , it was a vindication of their campaign to break off from the european union . </s>  nigel farage , the leader of the brexit party , said on twitter that mr. trump ’ s steps were “ drastic but necessary ” — evidence that “ the u.k. is now treated as an independent country. ” it was , said peter westmacott , a former british ambassador to washington , “ music to brexit ears. ” “ of course , ” he added , “ the announcement is of no help with the core issue right now , which is testing , so we can slow the spread . ” </s>    washington — when senator john barrasso , republican of wyoming , sought guidance on how to protect his family

dr. brian p. monahan , the attending physician of congress , told mr. barrasso , directing him to quarantine for 14 days before rejoining his family . </s>  “ you ’ re a visitor , ” dr. monahan said . </s>  but when house democratic leaders wanted counsel on whether they could safely reconvene in the capitol with covid-19 still spreading — a debate with political dimensions as a partisan divide was emerging across the country over how quickly to reopen — dr. monahan was less absolute . </s>  returning to washington carried health risks he would not recommend taking , he told speaker nancy pelosi of california and representative steny h. hoyer of maryland , the majority leader . </s>  but it was up to them to decide what to do . </s>  they opted to delay their return , and on friday , partly because of dr. monahan ’ s warnings , moved _forward with plans to institute remote voting in the future . </s>  it was typical of dr. monahan , the 59-year-old navy rear admiral who is known in the halls of the capitol as much for his meticulous attention to medical detail as he is for his efforts to stay completely out of politics . </s>  “ he is both an executive with lots of health care responsibilities — particularly now — and also has the unique relationship with members that a small-town doctor would have with the patients he knows and sees , ” said senator roy blunt , republican of missouri and chairman of the senate rules committee . </s>  “ he ’ s in a unique role at a unique time ” as government doctors have emerged as trusted public voices and political figures in the face of a fearsome pandemic — appearing in white house news conferences and as witnesses at marquee hearings — dr. monahan has maintained an uncommonly low profile . </s>  he never issued a public statement offering his opinion on whether congress should reconvene , although he shared his warnings with house leaders and privately told senior republican officials that his office did not have the capacity to screen all 100 senators for the coronavirus when they returned to work . </s>  when alex m. azar ii , the health secretary , said he would send 1,000 tests to capitol hill to accommodate them , ms. pelosi and senator mitch mcconnell , republican of kentucky and the majority leader , turned down the offer , wary of the optics of receiving special treatment at a time when testing was scarce — and prompting president trump to suggest on twitter that “ maybe you need a new doctor over there. ” dr. monahan , who declined to be interviewed , has been a calm and professional voice of reason during the pandemic , according to interviews with more than two dozen lawmakers , capitol officials and medical professionals who know him . </s>  they say he has taken a personal interest in his influential clientele , which also includes the nine supreme court justices , even as he fields politically charged questions about reopening , testing and precautionary measures . </s>  operating out of a nondescript clinic tucked away in the heart of the capitol , dr. monahan and a small staff have been exceedingly busy since the pandemic took hold , consulting with lawmakers who have contracted covid-19 or exposed to someone infected with it , doling out health recommendations in detailed memos ahead of votes , and producing a series of videos released on an internal website to educate lawmakers and their staff on how to protect themselves . </s>  dr. monahan has filmed and produced the videos by himself in his office , often seated next to an elaborate bouquet of white flowers and a tiny plastic model of a pangolin , the scaly mammal that may have been an intermediary carrier of the virus . </s>  in the videos , he typically walks through the most recent recommendations offered by the centers for disease control and prevention and demonstrates medical equipment , such as a thermometer and a variety of masks ( including one made by his wife , using a black shopping bag and a sewing machine ) . </s>  “ he has a big job — two houses of congress , two parties to deal with — but he ’ s not political in any way , ” ms. pelosi said . </s>  “ he treats

work out of the democratic cloakroom in 1928 after one lawmaker died and two collapsed , with several hours passing before a doctor could arrive in each case . </s>  two years later , the senate

was born in connecticut , the son of irish immigrants who came to the united states in the 1950s . </s>  his mother grew up in kilkee , while his father grew up in a house with a thatched roof without running water or electricity in lissycasey . </s>  the first in his family to attend college , he worked full-time at a supermarket while commuting in a yellow volkswagen beetle to fairfield university , a jesuit college — an education , he would tell graduates in 2011 , that meant , “ you are called to be ‘ men and women for others. ’ ” he studied biology and chemistry , and after graduating , joined the navy through its health professions scholarship program , enticed in part by the offer of free tuition and a living allowance in exchange for a commitment to three years of

center in bethesda , md. , he treated a 39-year-old woman for potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias . </s>  the patient had taken the popular antihistamine seldane , and his contribution to research on that medicine — and its connection to the arrhythmias — later helped lead to its removal from the market . </s>  dr. monahan rose through the ranks of the navy , becoming a professor of medicine and pathology at the uniformed services university of the health sciences in maryland , as well as participating in a number of national organizations related to cancer , oncology and hematology . </s>  while serving as the chairman of the department of medicine at the university , he received a call for a meeting in which officials with congressional leadership asked him to become the

for “ a tuneup ” before hiking the virginia section of the appalachian trail . ) </s>  in 2016 , it was dr. monahan ’ s assessment of justice antonin scalia ’ s health at the time of his death — including sleep apnea , coronary artery disease , obesity and diabetes — that influenced the decision to decline an autopsy of the justice , the associated press reported at the time . </s>  “ he was the one who advised me to go to the hospital , ” said representative ben mcadams , democrat of utah and one of the first lawmakers to contract the virus , said of dr. monahan . </s>  “ he was clear :

future. ” he moved to new york from tel aviv in february , along with his wife , stefanie , and their dutch shepherd , ester , with a plan to stay six months harvesting the guggenheim tomatoes . </s>  he was going to see the city , too . </s>  “ i went out once to a comedy bar , but that ’ s it , ” he said . </s>  the museum has been closed since march 13 , but mr. litvin still walks across central park every day around noon from his rental on the upper west side to tend to his flock . </s>  “ when you grow tomatoes on fifth avenue , you want to have the perfect tomatoes , there ’ s no room to mess up , ” he said . </s>  “ if i have ugly plants , i ’ ll hear it from the neighbors. ” these days , you can ’ t visit the mummies at the metropolitan museum of art or soak in “ the starry night ” at the museum of modern art . </s>  but you can still stand in front of the guggenheim and get a good look at a thicket of cherry tomato vines and a really big tractor . </s>  the tomatoes , housed in what looks like a radioactive shipping container on the sidewalk , were on view as part of the exhibition for just three weeks before the city folded in on itself . </s>  but they ’ re still growing , their vines snipped every tuesday and donated to city harvest , at least a hundred pounds at a time . </s>  “ this tomato-growing module couldn ’ t just be turned off with the lights , ” said the guggenheim curator troy conrad therrien , who organized the exhibition with the architect rem koolhaas , and samir bantal of amo , the research arm of mr. koolhaas ’ s firm . </s>  “ we brought the exhibition to the street , and the street is still accessible. ” the tractor is a top- of-the-line deutz-fahr 9340 ttv warrior . </s>  it has a computer in the cab , can lift more than 26,000 pounds and looks completely out of place on the upper east side . </s>  but the tomatoes look nice there . </s>  the shed ’ s color matches the guggenheim ’ s bone-white facade , and neat rows of vines — along with mr. litvin , when he ’ s there — are visible through a plate-glass window , bathed in a neon pink light that spills onto the sidewalk after sunset . </s>  mr. litvin works for 80 acres farms , a company that grows organic produce including cucumbers , leafy greens and herbs at giant indoor farms where controlled environments allow for year-round harvesting . </s>  they ’ re close to making it work for strawberries , too . </s>  while at the museum , mr. litvin prefers to work in the afternoon and evening to avoid crowds in central park , and because of the bees . </s>  the tomatoes need to be pollinated , so he has two small hives going in the module at a time , each living out of a specially designed cardboard box with little doors that open and close on a timer . </s>  this way , he can confine the bees ’ working hours to the morning so he doesn ’ t have to share 700 square feet with 100 agitated co-workers . </s>  “ i get them shipped to me here at the museum , ” he said of the beehives . </s>  “ the guards are like , ‘ what the hell is that humming noise ? ’ ” the technology mr. litvin is using at the museum is the same as in his commercial work . </s>  he controls the temperature , humidity and amount of “ daytime ” the tomatoes get . </s>  the light ’ s color maximizes energy efficiency , because the plants absorb only certain light from the spectrum . </s>  raised on a diet of sunshine and rainwater they are not , but they taste ( and smell ! ) </s>  like the best juicy ones found in backyards in august . </s>  in the context of the exhibition , these tomatoes — specifically , they ’ re brioso tomatoes — are meant to reflect the potential future of agriculture , a contrast to monocrop farms and their hulking , high-tech tractors like the ttv warrior , mr. therrien said . </s>  they were written about in the southeast produce weekly , which was an extremely rare appearance of the guggenheim in a publication dedicated to fruits and vegetables . </s>  inside the museum ’ s rotunda , the rest of “ countryside ” is closed off even to mr. litvin . </s>  he goes in through an employee side entrance once in a while to use the bathroom or buy something from the vending machine . </s>  the exhibition includes a spider-like robot that can harvest food , joseph stalin ’ s plans to plant 14 million acres of trees and an examination of climate change through siberian permafrost that emits methane and anthrax as it thaws . </s>  but mr. therrien hopes that the outdoor portion is even more relevant now . </s>  “ the supply chains are not just being disrupted but being reconfigured , ” he said . </s>  “ cities are battlegrounds in the pandemic , and the ability to move agriculture into cities is no longer just a flight of fancy for agriculture students who want to put gardens on top of skyscrapers. ” indeed , the tomatoes are being put to use . </s>  every wednesday , a city harvest van is loaded with about 3,000 tomatoes that mr. litvin has snipped , still on the vine . </s>  last week , the van also made pickups at a gristedes , a catering company and a momofuku restaurant before heading to la jornada food pantry in

painfully clear when , rather than taking the opportunity to unite and embrace a rising spirit of generosity and togetherness emanating around the globe , the president of the united states made a choice to sow division , publicly labeling covid-19 the “ chinese virus ” or “ wuhan virus. ” for many , this persistent mischaracterization has shattered any remaining hope that maybe , this time , we could do better . </s>  but for african people like me , who have witnessed the same phenomenon of attaching a disease to a nationality or ethnicity , it ’ s not a shock . </s>  besides the virus

</s>  now , as the world swings into action to contain coronavirus , this attitude is not less true , but more so : many regions are treating the pandemic with such great urgency only because powerful nations are falling victim to it . </s>  yet out of this scramble , a global effort must be made to change how we think about , talk about and understand disease . </s>  the lesson many people still need to learn is that disease is something that afflicts the human body — not the chinese body , the african body , or the western body . </s>  the moment a disease is regionalized , humanity is erased in a dishonest and dangerous attempt to reduce one another to a nationality . </s>  perhaps there ’ s a deeper psychological underpinning , as we try to shield ourselves mentally from anything

when we ’ re seeing a profound shift in the way we think about the other . </s>  social media allows us to see and hear first-person accounts from across the globe — from devastation to celebration .

cause is alien to the world in which we live . </s>  when i began painting on people ’ s skin , it taught me something indelible about the nature of human beings . </s>  my initial thinking was that

short-term : at every stage , donald trump minimized the threat and blocked helpful action because he wanted to look good for the next news cycle or two , ignoring and intimidating anyone who tried to give him good advice . </s>  but here ’ s the thing : even if he weren ’ t so irresponsibly self-centered , he has denuded the government of people who could be giving good advice in the first place . </s>  trump disbanded the national security council ’ s pandemic response team in 2018 , although he now , with his characteristic refusal to accept responsibility for anything , says that he knew nothing about it . </s>  and he has in general staffed his administration with obsequious toadies who never tell him anything he doesn ’ t want to hear . </s>  what ’ s now becoming clear is that when it comes to dealing with the economic fallout from covid-19 , the situation may be even worse . </s>  there are still some competent professionals holding senior positions at federal health agencies , who could give trump good advice if he were willing to listen . </s>  but serious economic thinking has effectively been banned from this administration , if not the whole republican party . </s>  as far as i can tell , the trump team is utterly incapable of formulating a coherent response to the gathering economic crisis . </s>  as a result , there are only two potential loci of intelligent economic policymaking left in washington . </s>  one is the federal reserve ; the other is the congressional democratic leadership . </s>  at this point , in other words , it ’ s pretty much up to jay powell , the fed chairman , and nancy pelosi , speaker of the house ; the question is whether trump and senate republicans will let them save the economy . </s>  powell , of course , slashed interest rates and announced a large asset-buying program on sunday . </s>  he was right to do so . </s>  but it ’ s painfully obvious that these moves won ’ t be sufficient , indeed will probably do little to stop the economy ’ s tailspin . </s>  remember , in 2007-8 the fed cut rates five times as much as it did sunday , and it still wasn ’ t able to prevent the worst slump since the great depression . </s>  in fact , powell himself basically acknowledged as much , declaring that he and his colleagues “ don ’ t have the tools ” to reach those most in need of help , and that “ fiscal responses are critical. ” fiscal responses , of course , have to come from congress . </s>  true , in another time , under another president , the white house would have played a crucial role in shaping crisis legislation . </s>  but last week , as the house drafted and then passed an economic relief bill — one that was helpful , if still clearly inadequate — it was almost entirely a democratic effort . </s>  democratic staff members put together the key elements of the bill — paid sick leave for many ( though not enough ) workers , enhanced unemployment benefits , increased federal contributions for

after subway ridership plunged a staggering 87 percent , or nearly 4.8 million riders , compared with the same day last year . </s>  personnel shortages forced the metropolitan transportation

enrollment in medicaid and that the congressional budget office has estimated would cause some states to reverse their expansions of coverage to childless adults without disabilities as part of the affordable care act . </s>  many medicaid beneficiaries would be subjected to work requirements and asset tests , and states would be pressed to verify eligibility for the program more often under the budget ’ s proposals , strategies that have been shown to reduce enrollment even among those who are eligible . </s>  states that preserve their medicaid expansions under the affordable care act would be asked to gradually pay a larger share of the medical bills for those patients . </s>  the budget would also reduce the federal share of spending for all medicaid patients , by changing rules about how states can offer extra payments to certain health care facilities run by state or county governments , a policy that the administration has already proposed as a regulation . </s>  it would reduce a funding stream meant for hospitals that serve a “ disproportionate share ” of uninsured patients . </s>  the budget also makes some small expansions of medicaid coverage : it would allow states the option to cover inpatient care for psychiatric care or drug addiction treatment . </s>  — margot sanger-katz medicare tweaked but not slashed for medicare , which the president has repeatedly pledged

hospital or a private practice . </s>  it also includes an effort to reduce payments to long-term care hospitals for patients after they are discharged from a regular hospital . </s>  the budget suggests , for the first time , allowing americans over 65 to opt out of medicare entirely if they wish . </s>  and it would allow medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a high-deductible health plan to set aside more tax-free savings for health expenses . </s>  it also calls on congress to pass legislation to reduce the prices paid for prescription drugs . </s>  such legislation , should it be

combined funding streams . </s>  — margot sanger-katz deep cuts to environmental initiatives the administration reserved some of its deepest cuts for the environmental protection agency , which would face a 26 percent reduction in funding and the elimination of 50 programs mr. trump deemed “ wasteful ” or duplicative . </s>  that ’ s about the level the administration has moved to cut the e.p.a .

administration with overseeing “ some of the cleanest air and water in the world ” while eliminating clean air and water regulations . </s>  after a decade of improvement in air quality nationally , federal data last year showed that fine particulate pollution has increased in the last two years . </s>  at the same time , the budget promotes a fossil fuel “ energy boom ” in the united states , including an increase in the production of natural gas and crude oil , both of which release carbon dioxide emissions responsible for warming the planet . </s>  republicans in congress this week are preparing to unveil a climate change agenda that focuses heavily on funding for “ innovation ” — like the development of carbon capture technology to store the planet-warming carbon dioxide that is released from power plants , or batteries to store solar power during periods of low demand . </s>  but under mr. trump ’ s 2021 budget plan , the department of energy , which oversees such federal

the budget reduces snap funding by about $ 180 billion between 2021 and 2030 . </s>  the white house has been making changes to the program on its own , including toughening eligibility requirements and cracking down on states that “ misuse ” work requirement waivers . </s>  in keeping with that approach , the budget proposes one set of work requirements for adults ages 18 to 65 who are able to work , rather than making a distinction on whether those adults have children or not . </s>  all adults who are able to work would have to engage in “ at least 20 hours or more ” of work or training in order to qualify for benefits . </s>  the budget also keeps mr. trump ’ s controversial “ harvest box ” proposal in place , continuing to suggest that poor americans who receive snap benefits get a

effective and that the funding could be redirected to other priorities , such as national security . </s>  the budget eliminates the choice neighborhoods program , which awards grants to neighborhoods with deteriorating public and federally assisted housing , arguing that states and local governments are better able to revitalize neighborhoods . </s>  mr. trump also requested less money for rental

patents and other duties , by more than 37 percent , the largest single cut to any agency . </s>  more than half of that decrease , though , was a reflection of decreased spending on the 2020 census , which will not be repeated next year . </s>  the budget also pares money for the trade adjustment assistance program , which is run through the labor department . </s>  the program offers training and support to workers who have lost their jobs as a result of outsourcing , but it has faced criticism that it may actually end up making its recipients worse off , by temporarily taking them out of the work force for training . </s>  the trump administration has proposed refocusing the program more on apprenticeships and on-the-job training . </s>  the cuts to the commerce department budget also include various reductions to economic development programs , which the administration says are duplicated elsewhere . </s>  the budget requests additional funding for investments in areas considered crucial for american competitiveness , particularly advanced technology , including artificial intelligence , quantum computing , advanced manufacturing and 5g telecom networks . </s>  the white house has proposed allowing the commerce department to auction off more telecom spectrum to private companies , one of the main bottlenecks in the country ’ s effort to advance 5g . </s>  the change would

</s>  the administration has completed nearly 120 miles thus far , almost all of it on federal land and in areas where there were sections of dilapidated wall or vehicle barriers . </s>  the $ 2 billion is significantly less than the $ 5 billion in wall funding that mr. trump sought a year ago , which resulted in a five-week government shutdown . </s>  while congress has previously agreed to provide only $ 1.375 billion for wall construction , mr. trump has found a way to secure money for his wall without congressional approval by shifting billions of dollars from military construction projects and programs used to crack down on narcotics activity . </s>  the proposal also includes $ 182 million to hire 750 border patrol agents and build processing centers for agents and another $ 544 million to hire more than 4,600 immigration and customs enforcement agents and immigration court prosecutors . </s>  the white house budget includes $ 3.1 billion for a daily average of 60,000

— for veterans affairs , including additional funding for suicide prevention , opioid addiction services and health care . </s>  such boosts have become fairly routine and tend to enjoy bipartisan support . </s>  however , the white house again proposed changes to cost-of-living calculations , which are used to determine payments for pensions and other compensation . </s>  the plan , which would “ round down ” the money owed to the nearest whole dollar , has sparked pushback from veterans and lawmakers , who say it unfairly robs veterans of money . </s>  — thomas gibbons-neff secret

security reshuffling that occurred after the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks . </s>  the budget argues that moving it would “ create new efficiencies ” in the investigation of financial crimes and prepare the united states to face “ the threats of tomorrow , ” such as the use of cryptocurrencies to finance terrorism . </s>  there appears to be bipartisan support for the move , but mr. mnuchin ’ s unwillingness to provide documents ahead of the 2020 election on what it has cost the secret service to protect the president and his family has complicated the effort . </s>  the trump administration

that work with the state department . </s>  it also eliminates funding for a food aid program that officials described as too slow to meet needs , economic and development accounts that impede direct assistance to specific countries in europe and asia , and for the asia foundation , a nonprofit that boosts good governance and empowers women . </s>  programs that would receive fewer funds include peacekeeping efforts by the united nations , which would be cut by $ 447 million , and the united states ’ annual contribution to the world body itself , by $ 508 million . </s>  the trump administration has long complained that the united states pays 22 percent of the united nations ’ annual budget , more than any other country . </s>  in 2018 , the administration ended funding to the

lack the coordination to do the full hand washing technique recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention , vigorously scrubbing both sides and between the fingers for at least 20

with joe biden . </s>  while the former vice president wasn ’ t the first candidate in the contest — he waited until late april last year to jump into the race — he maintained a lead that almost none of his 26 competitors could rival . </s>  none except bernie sanders . </s>  for a brief moment in early february , it looked as though the firebrand liberal senator from vermont might be able to win it all — iowa , new hampshire , nevada , and then cruise to the nomination . </s>  a poor showing on super tuesday marked the beginning of the end of his effort . </s>  and today , mr. sanders finally reached the conclusion that has seemed inevitable for more than a month , formally ending his second — and most likely final — bid for the presidency . </s>  within minutes of his exit , some of the most ardent bernie backers began blaming the “ democratic establishment ” for the defeat . </s>  it ’ s an argument mr. sanders obliquely referred to during his remarks to supporters this morning . </s>  “ the greatest obstacle to real social change has everything to do with the power of the corporate and political establishment to limit our vision as to what is possible , ” he said . </s>  that ’ s a case president trump is eager to seize upon , as he tries to exploit divisions within the democratic party for his own gain . </s>  “ this ended just like the democrats & the dnc wanted , ” he wrote on twitter , as mr. sanders spoke . </s>  “ the bernie people should come to the republican party. ” certainly , a fair number of democratic leaders , officials and superdelegates worried about a sanders victory , fearing his liberal proposals would alienate crucial swing voters in the general election . </s>  but to say that mr. sanders was blocked by a cabal of democratic power brokers who refused to let him win the nomination seriously overstates the power of the “ establishment ” in a moment when voters have less trust in government and democratic institutions than at any time in nearly half a century . </s>  like republicans ’ attempts to hurt mr. trump during the 2016 race , democrats ’ nascent efforts to undermine mr. sanders never got off the ground . </s>  the few that did were largely ineffective . </s>  there are no more smoke-filled rooms . </s>  in the end , mr. sanders lost the race himself . </s>  with his devoted base of support , the question facing mr. sanders ’ s campaign was always about his ceiling — not his floor . </s>  could he grow his following from the minority bloc that stuck with him in 2016 ? </s>  after four years of preparations , more

win over black voters , a group he struggled to woo in 2016 , largely failed . </s>  the coronavirus pandemic only deepened the challenge for mr. sanders , effectively freezing the primary with mr. biden well ahead . </s>  the question quickly became when — not if — mr. sanders would accept defeat . </s>  though mr. sanders has lost the nomination twice , he has “ won the ideological struggle , ” as he put it today . </s>  mr. biden may not have embraced “ medicare for all , ” but he has already adopted a number of left-leaning positions considered politically treacherous just four years ago , from his own public-option health care plan to a version of mr. sanders ’ s proposal for free college . </s>  but there are still signs that mr. biden will have to do more to win over mr. sanders ’ s coalition of young and liberal voters , many of whom are skeptical of party fixtures like the former vice president . </s>  tom perez , the chairman of the democratic national committee , pleaded for unity around “ our presumptive nominee ” as liberal , youth-driven organizations like the sunrise movement demanded changes in policy and personnel from mr. biden . </s>  mr. sanders hopes to push his rival even further , declaring that he is staying on the ballot in upcoming contests to collect delegates in hopes of influencing the party platform at the convention . </s>  but he also promised that democrats would enter the fall campaign “ standing united. ” clearly , mr. sanders does not have the same animosity for mr. biden that embittered the primary race four years ago . </s>  yet ,
